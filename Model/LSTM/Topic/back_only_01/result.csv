"After several months of eyeing this product and saving up for it, I was thoroughly disappointed when I received it. For a $150+ watch, I expected the quality to be of a higher caliber. It not only felt faked it had CHEAP written all over it and on top of that after one day of wearing it, one of the stones had fallen out...talk about insult to injury! I will say that Amazon's return process is absolutely FABULOUS! There was not buyer's remorse and I have my money back. I'll just stick to my Fossil",Seller Issue,Product Issue

"The shirts they send out are different from the pictures. They also are thin material and not quality at all like original authentic ralph lauren. They come with fake tags produced by some mark down company, and do not come with official blue and gold ralph lauren sale tags. Also they do not come in the original Polo By Ralph Lauren silver and blue bags. They come in a after market clear regular bag. These also lack the official stitching of real authentic Ralph Lauren shirts, you can not see the stitching around the collar, arm, or waist. This material is more like a Hanes undershirt and they are manufactured in unusual countries that Ralph Lauren does not list on its site. If you pay attention to the shirts and take time to examine you can see they are fake. The ponys on the shirt also are slightly different, there is excess stitch that is rough and goes across the legs instead of going behind. Also if you flip the shirt inside out you can see it is a regular shirt because they left the white shirt tags on the inside, and the tags have different locations and washing instructions that that on the collar. These are counterfeit shirts sold at a high price.",Product Issue,Product Issue
"OK, I mean, I'm pretty sure that these were acually FREE (plus $2.90 for shipping). So basically you pay $2.90 for a pair of sunglasses. They should not be used for anything more than going to a costume party as the Blues Brothers. They're a novelty. I always lose and break sunglasses, even the real ones, so I always buy the fake ones. If you are looking for a pair of cheap sunglasses to wear to the beach so you don't break or lose your real ones, don't even bother with this pair. They're THAT bad. You can get a pair for $6 that are polarized if you look around. These are extremely cheaply made, larger than you would think they would be (and therefore awkward), and they will break within a day.The only reason it earned 2 stars is because it cost less than $3. If it was $5, it would deserve 1 star.",Product Issue,Product Issue

They are very nice looking sunglasses for being fake. @ least in my opinion because i first saw the original Carrera @ Saks Fith Ave. Store in person and the quality was much better material wise.

Wow. Not even a good fake. There are very specific things that Ray-Ban will always have. One being the Ray-Ban logo and model number etched under the nose piece. Not there. The metal looks like painted plastic. I am disappointed. I purchase a huge variety of items from Amazon and sellers always do a great job. Currently purchasing a smart phone. Hope my next experience is better than this. In this particular case....buyer beware. Also note: I had some correspondence with seller prior to purchase.

"The first pair of these I ordered 6 months ago were perfect. I ordered an exact replacement after dropping the first pair to the bottom of a river. What came from Frames Direct were clearly knock-offs. They appear to have been a previous return, so I'm not sure frames direct is at fault. The lenses were thin cheap plastic and the etching scraped right off with my fingernail. Also they came in a brown case (not black as the previous pair). Finally, the Rayban logo on the side was just glued on top. They weren't even a good knockoff. Come on scam artists, take some pride in your work! Just from the heft I could tell they were not real. Return processed easily for a replacement, hopefully my next pair will be authentic.Update: 27Sep2015Second pair received. Even more fake... if that's possible. This pair also had all of the above defects, and did not have the etching in the lens. Cancelled order I'll try from a different seller (not Frames Direct).",Product Issue,Product Issue
"Fake!! Do not purchase! The Ray Bans I received are fake replicas and I'm returning them. I bought an identical pair of Ray Bans from an authorized dealer and when I compared them the weight and quality of the sunglasses is not the same. Don't get fooled. These replicas have all the correct markings on them, however the size of the writing is not the same as authentic Ray Bans. My brown sunglasses also came in a black leather case instead of the brown leather case. That was the first mistake I saw.

The pair I got were defective. Sounds like other customers have had the same problem. The frame was very squeaky and loose. It seems like I got a pair of fake Ray Bans.

"I purchased these boots despite the negative commentary regarding the quality of the boot. I had faith that Dansko would never put their name on an inferior product and perhaps the negative reviews were anomalies. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the negative reviewers.The boot's leather quality was awful - it was hard, plastic-like, and absolutely uncomfortable. It felt like I had purchased $9.99 fake leather boots from Walmart. Interestingly, inside the boot where the size was stamped I found a manufacture date of 11th May 2009. I purchased these in November 2010. I have returned these boots and have since found the exact same boot (with current 2010 manufacture date) at a major department store. The leather on these boots is soft, supple, and true to Dansko quality. So beware and check the manufacture date on your boots! With the newer boots I agree with the positive reviewers and find this to be a fantastic, stylish, and comfortable boot.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"I purchased these for my mom who wears a women's size 10. They were supposed to be a replacement for her regular style Croc clog's.My mom is a creature of habit, so when she told me they were too small I thought she was just reluctant to part with her old pair. When I inspected them, they were indeed much smaller. Like maybe a women's 7 or 8! The sizing label and lettering was identical to her old pair (which was purchased at a brick and mortar store). I'm not sure what happened. Maybe they were a fake brand? The size difference was too much to just be a difference in the Baya and traditional clog style. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the shoes back from my mom in time to return. Next Crocs will have to be an in store purchase again.",Product Issue,Product Issue
"I was considering this watch as a purchase. There are a ton of reviews that say this watch is to die for and how great it looks in person but a few reviewers had a very different opinion on the quality of the watch once received.

When he stated the differences between a real one & a fake one and I hate fake ones at any cost but he did show a flaw in the design of this particular model here and I did some of my own research and found out that he was 100% correct. This Michael Kors watch is a knock off (Fake) or what we say in Brooklyn a Fugayzie... I would love to buy the real one on Amazon but feeling kind of leiry after this close call.

"Im updating my review for these pants and downgrading them from 5 to 1 stars. Why? After purchasing 6 pairs I have found the following to be true.01) The wear is extremely poor. Granted I give my pants pretty rough treatment but these have extremely poor abrasion resistance. Now I find I have to patch them after (get this) wearing them one time.02) Can't get them clean. The teflon prevents detergent from getting in and cleaning the pants of just regular old dirt.Bottom line. These are fake and will not last. Despite being well designed, they are of very poor quality. I am done with Propper and I advise you to be also.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"Please be careful buying on Amazon.com for this item. I bought the ox red backpack under the assumption this is a great deal for a great backpack, and this bag's color bled onto my white clothes (shirt and shorts), staining them irrevocably with shades of red. I called Fjallraven and they told me their bags usually do not do that (they don't hear about that at all). Another thing is the foam pad that comes with the backpack wouldn't go back into the compartment it came in, and also curled up (again irrevocably).I ended up getting a kanken from the actual store, and the padding is visibly thicker and so is the backpack material. I have a feeling the color won't bleed with this authentic one. Buyer beware.

In addition, the bag is most definitely NOT water resistant.

I thought maybe it was just because they were new and I needed to wear them in and stretch the fabric out a little bit... nope! Another thing I should have caught was that the color is way off. I bought the Ash color to replace my current pair and it is a lot darker. Wish I had read some reviews and not ordered these. I was busy and thought I had more time to return these, but waited too long. Now I'm stuck with a pair of fake shoes that don't fit me. Do your research and don't waste your money on these.

"I ordered an 8 1/2 (I can usually wear an 8 or 8 1/2). They sent me one shoe that was a 9 and one shoe that was a 10!! The 9 was tight...fit like a 7 1/2 - 8. The 10 had a good quarter inch gap at my heel. They look like Tom's...even the box looks authentic (in reference to those saying these are fakes/knockoffs). I've never owned a real pair of TOMS, so I cannot tell if they're real or not. One other reviewer mentioned a TM mark vs. TOM's R mark. The ones I received do not have ANY mark at all...beside the name TOMS or beside the name SKECHERS! There is a tag hooked on with a TINY circle mark by the name Skechers....I had to get a magnifying glass out to see what was inside the circle. I don't know, but to ME, it looks like a star or the letter M. So....without having an authentic pair next to these to compare to, I'd still guess that they're indeed knockoffs. Not sure how well they'll hold up. No one else would be able to tell by glancing at them on your foot that they're not real TOMS, but purchasing these, defeats the purpose of your purchase helping someone less fortunate have a pair of shoes on their feet! But.... if you end up purchasing these anyway, I'd order up one size. Oh, and the Ash ones I ordered are a dark greyish taupe....loved the color...a great neutral. Too bad I don't trust them now.

Authentic toms have the insoles sewn into them, and with the pair I received, the insole came right out! Not to mention the pattern on the inside does not match the pattern for black toms listed on the TOMS website. I have NEVER been so disappointed with a TOMS purchase. Please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT waste your money.

The one I received that I opened had no matching numbers. Also I looked at the pairs I bought thru Amazon before and they also don't match. Really would be nice for Amazon to carefully check suppliers and have a seal of approval as genuineBut after all this.. I am keeping the two pairs since they were cheap and look good.

"I am flat out pissed at Levi's at this point. The SEVENTH pair of Levi's 559 jeans ordered from Amazon. Different colors, but even worse, DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN. My goodness, the only pair that fit me half decently were the pair from Pakistan. They at least had a decent fit, look like relaxed straight leg jeans, and have a material very similar to denim. The rest... god the rest... the rest are just pure trash. A pair from Mexico that claim to be size 38 but fit like size 34's with super tight thighs and bell bottom like ends. A pair from Egypt that have an almost fake feel to the denim and an over sized waist with very tight calve sections. A pair from Vietnam that just don't fit at all due to a really weird 'poof' feel to the back side. I'm so fed up with this. What happened to this company? What happened to Levis making denim jeans for the everyday man and woman? Is your manufacturing process so scattered that you can't even pull together the same materials?? Or roughly the same measurements? I mean come on, how does a size 44 equal a size 38 but a size 38 equals a size 42? Bah hum bug is right, Levis should be ashamed that they are even offering jeans for sale online with this type of quality and manufacturing differences.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"I ordered three pairs of jeans and two of them are most likely not real Levis. The thread color on the pockets was a almost neon green color. I'm use to seeing the same orange stitching throughout the entire pant. The Levis patch on the back looks fake. The zipper is very different! The actual tab you use to zip and unzip is very distinctive on real Levis. They have a raised notch stamped into them and the Levis logo engraved into the tiny tab. The ones I got were just a flat copper tab, no notch, no logo. And the biggest giveaway, the fit! I'm use to my 550's fitting loose but comfortable but these fakers were tight around the leg and fit terrible around the waist. Like I said, one pair was the real deal and I was able to compare them side by side. Unfortunately, I noticed these things when I first put them on...after I had washed them like I do with all of my clothes. So of course I could not return them. Spend the extra and go to your local mall and buy the real deal. I hope these are not what Levi's is cranking out these days.",Product Issue,Product Issue

It's sad that they're advertising they are THEE ORIGINAL salt water sandals by hoy shoes. I've had most of salt water sandals for over 15 years! First time I opened this it didn't have a box. First look it was a NO for me...the leather felt horrible. The fit was not like a glove and best indication was it didn't say MADE IN USA. I even had to text a friend to make sure I wasn't crazy. Her salt waters said MADE IN USA. It's kind of scary Amazon allows fakes to be sold online.,Product Issue,Product Issue
"I read the other reviews and noted that people said there were bumps in the front of this wig, but I figured that just meant the hair was sticking up and could be pinned down into place. Unfortunately, however, the manufacturer added a weird layer of fake hair/sponge under the top layer that is braided...it's like of like Wednesday Addams meets Jersey Shore. Her hair never had any lift and was always slicked flat into braids, so I wouldn't call this wig accurate to the character at all. I suppose they are trying to make Wednesday sexy or something. At any rate, it's probably possible to find something better...I've tried to get it to flatten and it really won't, so I'm considering trying to cut out the weird layer of stuffing but might wreck the wig. The quality seems great, and the rest of the wig is smooth...but it just doesn't look right with that much body.Update: I did end up cutting out the weird layer of stuffing hair (let's say it looks like chest hair) and also unbranded and rebraided the wig. It looks much better because the extra body up front is gone and the braids are now at the sides of the head near the ears instead of at the back of the head. So much better, but annoying to have to alter so much.",Product Issue,Product Issue

It's so flimsy and low quality I won't be surprised if this item is found on dollar store shelves a year from now. The bag also has a terrible odor to it when you first get it. I had to put it in the garage to air it out before I could even give it a proper inspection. Some people and businesses that sell this product on Ebay even warn in their sales pitch that the item will have a strange smell when you receive it and will need to be aired out in a ventilated area to rid it of the smell.

"The Corset is pretty to Look at But useless to me. I am a 32-C and even finding regular bras that are affordable can be Challenging b/c it's a rare and unusual size. It's assumed that if you are a 32 and Reasonably busty, you probably have fake D or DD cup boobs. If it's all natural then you must be a B cup or smaller -_- SO Finding lingerie and even clothing can be a challenge sometimes.In the cheapie (charlotte Ruse and other) stores I am almost ALWAYS an extra small in tops and knock-off corsets so I figured the 32 corset should be a good fit right? Boy was I WRONG!! The waist and the hips are fine, but even with a bra underneath the bust is HUGE!! Another person who made a review Mentioned the bust thing before. She was a 34 and had to go down to a 32, but what am I supposed to do? They don't have a size 30 so obviously I will have to go through all the trouble of getting my money/ future credit back. I can promise you my 32 corset is at Least a 34! It was sooo huge that I had at least a 2 inch gap between my Chest/ Armpits/ Back All around.

"AS I'VE PREVIOUSLY POSTED WITH REGARDS TO ANOTHER ONLINE PURCHASE, BE WARNED when ordering Clarks Desert Boots and Originals online as it can be a BIG GAMBLE as there no consistency in Clarks' sizing, both in terms of length and width.Briefly, my story based on my recent experiences using Amazon.com - Despite doing a large of amount of research before buying, 3 out of 4 of the pairs of Clarks boots that I've ordered online have proven not to fit true to the advertised size.And, specifically in the case of this order for a pair of Beeswax leather desert boots, the size on the box did not actually match the actual size of the boots sent to me, making them too big to wear comfortably. Very annoying and expensive.Significantly, these online purchases has proven both disappointing and costly as given that they have been international orders, it has proven not viable in terms of international shipping costs to post back to the sender.I'm a fan of Clarks Desert Boots as a product, however buying them online can be a costly gamble as depending on the age of stock (Clark has recently changed it's sizes from a narrow fit to standard fit) and the reliability of the sender's information and service (the online product description doesn't match the actual delivered product), you can end up shoes that do not fit properly.My suggestion based on my experience, unless you don't mind your shoes/boots being too loose or too tight, buy shoes after trying them on in person, not online, as you will never know what you will receive.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I've been looking for a warm, cozy pair of slippers with an indoor/outdoor type outsole.  My issue with this pair of slippers is poor fit and disappointing inner and outer soles.I wear a 9.5 B in woman's sizing. If I wore a 10.5 shoe, perhaps the fit would be better, but it doesn't work for a size 9.5. They are too loose, especially the part that wraps around my heel. It is not snug enough to keep the slippers on my feet while walking: my heels slip up and down and I have to work at trying to keep the slippers from coming off by spreading out my toes. This makes  walking awkward and unpleasant. I flop around in these....more like wearing a slider than a moc.I also did not like the flatness of the inner sole which contributes to the loose feel of the slippers--no shaped liner for some arch support. And I was mislead by the product description claim that these slippers are ""great for taking Scruffy the dog out for his morning gaunt"" [sic]. I expected a more substantial outer sole. Within one minute of trying them out I realized they'd have to go back.I finally found what I wanted! For those that want a more substantial and perfect fit winter slipper, check out Haflinger boiled-wool slippers.

They run far more than a size to big, which makes me wonder why Rothco doesn't just re-label the size. I wear anywhere from a 10.5-11, so I opted to order a 10 - thinking a little wiggle room would be ok. Worst case scenario, I could put in some Dr. Scholl's insoles, right? wrong.The issue I had, was that the leather, like all new boots, was very stiff, so I couldn't tell exactly how drastically off-size they were. I knew I had a little wiggle room either way, but decided to break them in. Three days in, I knew they were WAY too wide, and over a full size too big. I bought some thick insoles, and they helped, but not enough to continue wearing them.The quality of the leather, and the simplistic design are AWESOME, but these boots need to be brought in at least two inches per boot to fit the average size foot width, and have the sizes re-labeled.

"I love how the shoe fits. It fits like a dream. I have had this shoe for a while, and it's very comfortable to wear. I actually bought this shoe a second time, because I thought it was a different shoe.So why the low rating?Because it's not an all white shoe. The ""white smooth"" in the pictures is essentially the exact shoe that I would like to have and to wear. Unfortunately, it does not look like the picture. The tongue of the shoe is a weird light green/off-blue. It almost looks as if you have worn new blue jeans, and accidentally stained the tongue. But that's what this shoe looks like new. It's extremely disappointing.I kept my first pair, and I still wear them. After they got dirty, and after some creative lacing, the tongue is less noticeable. When I ordered this shoe again (I did not order my first pair from Amazon... so I thought this would actually be a white shoe), I was disappointed that it looked so terrible.One star is a harsh rating - especially for a comfortable shoe. But I can't give it more than one star when it's product description and photos do not match the actual product.I will happily buy DC shoes again - I love how comfortable and wide they are... perfect for me feet.

Not terrible...but only barely worth the price (26 bucks) paid from a Gold Box sale.  It is NOT worth the listed 125!  No way.The bands are NOT LEATHER...some people state that they are, but they are most definitely synthetic.  I notice that NOW the item's description has been corrected to ""synthetic leather"" -- when I bought it, the description clearly stated ""leather"".  One reviewer said they could tell ""by the smell"" that it was leather...but my bands smell just like a new shower curtain!  So believe the current product description: it's SYNTHETIC leather.Overall, the bands are pretty cheap feeling, somewhat tough and inflexible.  The watch bezel is smaller than it seems in the picture.  My watch face isn't even placed quite right -- the 12 o'clock position is just slightly off-center (!)The interchangeable face plates actually are what hold the straps in place -- you screw it onto the top and it sort of ""clamps"" down on the strap's metal hooks.  It feels secure...ish.  For now, at least.The strap's buckle is kind of sharp on the edges, and feels somewhat uncomfortable when I wear it.

"20 months or so ago, I purchased a pair of Bistro directly from the Crocs website and was supremely happy with my choice. At the time, I followed other reviewers' advice to purchase the clogs 1 size smaller at 6 Women's/4 Men's than my usual size of 7 W/5 M. As mentioned, I could not be happier with my Crocs which I still currently work in despite their falling apart soles. Compared to working in a busy kitchen environment with any other shoes (I work a lot!), my experience with my old Bistro clogs (made in China) was blissful. I also learned from other buyers that Crocs made in China are somewhat roomier than the ones made in Mexico. This turned out to be an important distinction. Fast forward to this recent purchase from ShoeBuy (the vendor) via Amazon, these Crocs were made in Mexico (a fact not mentioned or the sizing difference explained in the product description). I cannot say anything about their wear outside of the sizing as these Crocs are too small for me to even put on. When I was making the purchase, I actually tried to order in my correct size (7 W/5 M) but was advised by Amazon that based on my size and previous purchases to go for size 6 W/4 M. For the last week, I have been trying unsuccessfully to return these too-small clogs to ShoeBuy (minus restocking fee) in order to repurchase Bistro in a larger size but that is another story.The takeaway moral of this tale is to(a) make sure you know the manufacturing source and provenance of the clogs (made in Mexico or China); and,(b) avoid purchasing from ShoeBuy even if their prices may be slightly lower than other vendors. I requested a refund (minus restocking fee) and was promised a return shipping label within an hour twice, once via email and the last time over the phone with their sales rep. Still no return shipping label after a week (I do know all about checking spam and other email folders).Avoid ShoeBuy, avoid, avoid!

"I bought 4 pairs of these pants. Loved 3. 1 of them, Olson A Pinstripe/Faded Navy, 32x32, was terrible.

The production description is very poor for this item since all of the pants say ""22% polyester /78% cotton"" though there are apparently large variations in the fabric.

"Wow. I just got this item in the mail today and I'm not only disappointed, I'm pretty mad. My shirt does NOT look like the image on the product description page. Yes, it's navy blue. Yes, it has the image of Spider-man on it. However, the image only covers two-thirds of the front of the shirt - not the whole front. If that was the only issue, I would have just been disappointed. However, the fact that it WAS NOT CENTERED on the shirt just makes me mad! The image was applied so that it begins about seven inches down from the shirt collar and extends to the bottom hem. Why do I want seven inches of blank navy cloth at the top? Ridiculous! And it isn't centered along the horizontal axis, either! There's about a two inch margin to the sleeve on one side and a four inch margin to the sleeve on the other! Who applied this image, a six-year old? I just can't see any excuse for this. I am going to contact the seller and ask about a replacement. When I hear back from them (or not), my review will either be dramatically improved or even more harshly critical. Right now, I can only strongly warn people against purchasing this product, or, more specifically, ANYTHING from this seller! One of the few products I have rated as a one-star item...***Review Update as of 10/11/14***I returned the defective shirt via amazon's product return system, and this was free of charge. Yes! I thank-you for the easy return, amazon! I dropped off the box I was returning the shirt in to the local UPS store and received confirmation of the return the same day. Again, thanks to amazon for this simple return procedure/policy. Two days after I notified amazon that the product I received was defective, I received my replacement shirt. (I could have opted for a reversal of charge on the product price or for a product replacement, and I chose the replacement option.) Again, I thank amazon for the quick shipping of the replacement item! Five stars to amazon across the board for the entire return and replacement process!Now for the bad news. The new shirt I received had (for the second time) the screen print off-center. It wasn't as bad as the first time. The first time the centering was absolutely horrible. This time it was just poor. This time the image was affixed several inches higher (maybe about three inches from the shirt collar). The image still rand down below the bottom edge of the shirt, though. To be done correctly, the image would really need to start about ONE INCH from the collar, so it was still lower than it should have been. The horizontal centering was just as bad as before. The image is heavily shifted to the right side of the shirt and I find myself wanting to tug it to the left so that it is centered on my chest. This obviously does not work, so I am still disappointed in the overall quality of the shirt. If all of these shirts have print defects, the price on them should be $5.00 or less. This is a crying shame, as the image is just really, really cool, and the glow-in-the-dark effects are just icing on the cake. Printing the shirt off-center like this is just a travesty. So, I am going to upgrade my rating from a single star to two stars, but that's the best it's getting from me. People really need to know that these shirts are poorly produced before they spend their money on them. I know I wish I would have known this before I had gone ahead with this purchase. I would have picked a different shirt than this one if I had known about the print defects.One last thing that should be made clear: This shirt DOES glow in the dark! I saw one reviewer stating that it doesn't glow, and I don't know why he would make a false statement like that, but IT DOES GLOW! Maybe he doesn't know how to activate a shirt like this? It's not like this shirt uses batteries, of course. The phosphorescent portions of the shirt are light activated! That means that you need to have the printed image of this shirt in contact with light (the brighter and more natural the better) to ""excite"" the phosphorescent parts (in this case, the white portions) of the shirt. Once the shirt is ""charged up,"" you can enter a darkened area and see the luminous white parts glowing in the dark. The effect will fade out after a while. It may glow for twenty minutes or so, but it WILL NOT glow all night or hour after hour. If you want a shirt that ""lights up"" all night, buy a different shirt than this one!!!",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I bought this watch to use scuba diving.  The product description states ""suitable for recreational scuba diving.""  Why else would it be good to over 600'?  Here are quotes from the User's guide that came with the watch.Do not use this watch for scuba diving or other types of diving that require air tanks.Even if a watch is water-resistant, do not operate its buttons or crown while it is submersed in water or wet.The battery that comes loaded in your watch when you purchase it is used for function and performance testing at the factory.This type of test battery may go dead quicker than the normally rated battery life as noted in the User's Guide.  Note that you will be charged for replacement of this battery, even if replacement is required within the watch's warranty period.When replacing the battery, also request a check for proper water resistance.  Note that you will be charged separately for water resistance inspection.The watch looks nice and seems to work well on the surface.  But using the buttons while diving (for the compass, which will not stay on for longer than a few seconds after taking a reading or the stop watch for interval timing) is apparently out.  I will use them anyway and if the watch quits, I will update this review with the results.  I am also disappointed that they don't charge a couple more bucks and put the best battery they can find in the watch.

I initially wasn't bothered by this because I tend to be a little warm blooded but they are not holding up well at all! I have worn them maybe 3 or 4 times and they are starting to pill where my arms brush against my chest during work. The stitching isn't reinforced so don't feel that they are going to hold up well with continued wear. I have had one pair rip at the seams in the crotch when I was bending down playing with my son.  I really wish they had been as nice as the other contrast trim sets that I purchased, if I could return them I would, but they have been worn and laundered so now I'm stuck with them. I'm not sure why there is such a difference in these two scrubs from the same company but I wish that I wouldn't have wasted my money on these. :(",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"yeah sure I wanted a good deal for some t-shirts, and I thought I got it. I was expecting better from Hanes, that was my mistake don't make that mistake yourself. the shirts are supposedly cotton, well they don't feel one bit like my old 100% cotton T-shirts, true they are older and it shows, but they do not pick all the lit inside the dryer like Hanes', the material feels stronger and more resistant than Hanes', and they do feel more comfortable than Hanes', but why might that be? Hanes' T-shirts were made in Haiti apparently, while my older T-shirt were made in Mexico and China, think about it for I don't not know what to think of it. maybe Im missing something I don't know a lot about the mechanics when it comes to produce an item at the lowest cost possible in a country where the manpower is ultra cheap, I just wanted black T-shirst, which are usually expensive, and this did seems like quite a good deal (not great though according with some friends) but what I would really ,really , like its that the product description included where the T-shirts were fabricated, because so far, it looks like it matters.Final verdict: Do not buy them! even for cheap T-shirst like these, either the deal or the price (maybe both) should be better than what I paid.PSyes Im keeping the T-shirts and Im wearing them, economically speaking there is no point returning them (unless I bought a dozen which I didnt, ) but only because Im that much of a sucker. I did throw one of mine to a naked hobo walking along the highway though.Update:very important by the time I bought the T-shirts the price was around $23.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

They definitely had skinny men or possibly women in mind when they designed these things.They do look nice though and had they fit properly they would have made a fine costume addition.

"I have worn Levi jeans for 40 years, from when I was a young teenager.  I recently decided to buy a new pair of 505 Regular Fit Jeans to replace one pair that was wearing out, and I decided to buy them here vice a department store.  The product description reads ""they are cut to sit at the waist, comfortable throughout the seat and thigh ... "".  Levi 505's I've bought and worn in the past certainly ""fit"" that description.I noticed that the leading reviews, mostly written in 2011, were strongly negative and stated that Levi has changed these jeans without warning, changing the cut and fit, although more recent reviews seem to be better.  Gambling that Levi has reverted to sizing these the way I've grown accustomed to wearing, I ordered a pair.  However, now that they've arrived, I can see that what was wrong in 2011 is still wrong in 2016, as discussed below.First off, I'm long waisted and need a full rise jean (ie, I truly need them to be cut high enough to sit at the waist) in order to look good on me.  However, these jeans are cut a full 2 inches lower across the waist and ride much too low than my old pairs.  They do NOT sit at the waist, and if I try to pull them up high enough to look correct on me, I'm squeezing myself in places that no man should be squeezed in.  They also are not comfortable across the seat.  This change in cut alone is a show-stopper for me.  However, there are a couple of other ways these jeans bother me.  First, the material feels thinner/cheaper than my old jeans. While they could ""thicken"" after repeated washings/wearings, I don't think they will.  Second, they are much darker than in the picture and look to be almost unwashed.  This will fix itself over time, but if I wanted darker jeans, I would have ordered them that way.  And third, the pockets are much tighter/smaller than before, so that I won't be able to comfortably carry the things that I now carry in my jean pockets.The only reason I'm not giving this a one star review is because the waist width and leg length are sized correctly and the jeans are constructed well, but that is damning with faint praise.  If you haven't been wearing these for years and if you like your jeans to ride low, then you may like these.  However if you're an old-timer like myself, heed the warnings I didn't heed, and look elsewhere for your blue jeans.  The 505 jeans you knew and loved are gone.  Two stars.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"i can't believe Levi's put their once good name on this cheaply made and inferior quality product. The denim fabric is very thin, and with that comes the understanding that this fabric, and its seams, cannot possibly hold up to the wear and tear that the old Levi's jeans could. That Levi's, and Amazon, didn't mention this in the product description is a disgrace.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"The one star is an alert to confusing advertising on Amazon.A warning for those considering this purchase: There are two descriptions in the advertisement - one evidently is for the WT910, which is a lightweight mesh, for warm-weather use. The other is evidently for the WT910 GT, which is lined with Gore-Tex for cold-weather use.The product, though, in the Amazon advertisement, is called the WT910, which is what I thought I was ordering - the warm-weather shoe.I may end up keeping the GT, which is what I received, as it appears to be warm and fits well (it's basically the WT910 with Gore-Tex sewn inside as a lining).But I am hoping a second try with ordering the WT910 will result in my having the lighter-weight shoe I ordered.On the positive side, should I decide not to keep the GT version, Amazon was willing to pay for return shipping, due to the unclear product description. UPDATED: For some reason, the gray-blue arrived as the lightweight version, the WT910, at least in the 6.5 wide, so I am very pleased. The gray-green, the GT.*****I'd give both styles of the shoe five stars.*****And, it turned out to be a fortunate mistake that I initially received the WT910GT, as the Gore-Tex-lined version is also very comfortable on the still-cooler mornings and, I hope, will be a nice break from heavier boots for winter walking.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"When I first put these gloves on I was horrified at how absolutely cheapo they looked. I felt I had been absolutely jipped. There were threads sticking out all over, and there was this horrible white stuffing like thing going on in the gloves that made them absolutely unwearable in public. They weren't even nylon as advertised. In case something changes, this is the copy-paste of the product description.Product DescriptionMade of 100% nylon. One size with botton closure. 9 inches long, 3 inches wide. Thin, soft and stretchable material. Hand Wash Only. Available in white color. Imported  Just like that. Down to the missing period at the end. When I got these gloves they came in dollar-store plastic packaging with the stereotypical cheap-junk, mass-produced, Chinese import cardboard label thing, stapled together to the plastic. Mildly suspicious, I opened the package and checked the glove label. Here is the exact information I saw.ITEM NO.:8108100% POLYESTERONE SIZE FITS MOST.RN# 88490 FUN WORLD DIV.MADE IN SHANG YU ,ZHE JIANG,CHINA11060CGP14MFG.DATE:JAN.-MAR./2011  From what I had seen earlier I wasn't surprised this actually came from China. The material was thin as advertised,but nylon it was not. Maybe they mislabel the amazon ad. The weave seem okay- it didn't seem like it was going to fall apart as soon as I put it on. As for the stretch, they do stretch sideways maybe an Inch and 1/2, but could only get a finger to stretch about a quarter inch longer max. The size was suprisingly nice on my miniature little girl hands (A male I am) but they sure as hell aren't 1 size fits most(Maybe in China it might). On the scale of mens gloves I'd say they're about about an X-SMALL that'll go up to a SMALL or maybe- just maybe- MEDIUM. The fit wasn't what you'd call snug ,at least for me, and the gloves kinda just bunched up and hung there. Maybe if I had buffer hands the fit would be nicer, but it's loose on me. They extend an inch down on the wrist. The material is too thin for the snap closure it comes with and if you're not careful, I think it likely to rip there. The closure is also of an ugly ivory color.  I was disappointed with these gloves. Surely they cost only $5 but damn they weren't even passably wearable in public, like halloween costume gloves. Looking back at these ugly gloves I remembered things can sometimes be fixed to  an extent so I turned them inside out to see if anything could be done. I found that they hadn't been well finished at all and the seams had an enormous excess that had caused that bunching of white stuff inside so I went ahead and cut as much of the excess of as possible without ruining the gloves. 10 or minutes of careful labor won me a better finished pair of gloves that when I put them on, actually were okay. I Still wouldn't wear them in public they're of passable quality for private use. (I had intended to use them for reading, to the end of not maring and curling the page edges with sweat oft caused by the Florida heat).  After a bit of labor and maybe mis-communication I had a pair of gloves, of some utility, That I could use for my purposes. Still, they weren't what I thought they'd be, and I wouldn't buy these particular gloves again, but for $10(the shipping for these $5 gloves is another $5)they may suit you're purposes.  All in all, Two star gloves.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I had Avia shoes for work for many years, and they were great.  So did a friend of mine.  When our workplace changed our dress code to black, we both went for these, without even knowing that's what the other was doing.  When we figured it out and got to talking about it later, we learned that we were both miserable, and frantic to figure out what to do.Those ""removable insoles"" that they mention in the product description are in fact removable--and it's a good thing.  They are PATHETIC.  Very thin, NO padding at all.  They actually feel HARD.  Shouldn't shoes that tout themselves as walking shoes have some padding?  I know Reebok's walking shoes do!I ended up pulling out that miserable excuse for an insole and replacing it with a $20 insert, which made these shoes a lot more expensive.  But now, they feel too small, as the extra thickness has taken up too much room inside.  I will never buy Avia again.  It's too important to keep feet comfortable to risk them on this brand.One more thing.  I found no evidence whatsoever on or in the shoes or the tags that they are leather.  Given that leather is a great selling point, it's hard to believe that this would not be printed somewhere.  I couldn't detect a leather scent, either.Recently, I bought two pairs of Reeboks--Zig Heel and Zig Tech Shark, both of which are very comfortable and well padded.  Unfortunately, neither are black, but with their custom option, I just might pay the big bucks and put some black ones together.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

Disappointment number 2.Finally the third (and final) disappointment that made me decide to return the bag was that as I was checking all of the zippers, one of the side ones was already broken! It did that thing where the seam reopens after the zipper had already passed through, ""closing"" it.This bag just had too many negatives for me in the first 2 minutes of md taking it out of the box and examining it.

"I'm at a loss to explain all of the positive reviews for this item.Pleats are -inch, not -inch as advertised.Shirt is cut way too large. I'd say that the supposedly 14.5"" neck fits closer to a 16"" neck. The rest of the shirt is similarly wide. Anticipate alterations, especially if you might take off your jacket at some point. Even if you won't, its poofiness will negate a well-cut jacket, and the shirt will likely bloom out the front of your closed jacket. Unless you are a big guy, this will look like a pirate shirt on.Given that this is a tuxedo shirt, I would've thought that a French cuff was the natural choice to go with, rather than the convertible barrel cuff here. Yes, you can convert these barrel cuffs for use with cufflinks, but who wants to see an additional plastic button next to their cufflinks? Plus, the product description says that studs and cufflinks are not necessary, which is not the case.

One has a very thin slice on the side of the shoe, like an Exacto knife would make. There are several indentions on two of the shoes. One is right on the top of it, so it's very noticable, and one has it on the back. I would compare these indentions to what a crimped plastic coathanger would leave on your clothes after it's been hanging for ahwile, except with this shoe material it's staying there, it will not go away. Two of the heels have a small area where the it's peeled up, so you see a white mark on the heel where the teal color material is torn. Basically, lots of minor damage to the shoes, and there was nothing about this described in the product description. Also, I wear an 8 1/2 and had to order a 9 since half sizes are not available, and they are very wide all around my foot. I figured a size down would be too small, so I ordered up, so beware if you normally wear a half size, they will most likely be too big or too small depending on which route you take. Very dissapointed with my order, especially since I bought two pairs and both pairs had damage to them. I counted down the days until these shoes arrived, only to be let down.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"""Women's Galaxie Shearling Slipper,"" this is called. ""Cozy shearling lining,"" claims the product description. Shearling. What is shearling?  ""Shearling is a skin from a recently sheared sheep or lamb that has been tanned or dressed with the wool left on. It has a suede surface on one side and a clipped fur surface on the other,"" says Wikipedia. That's what I thought! Do we object to using Wiki as a reference? Well, that first sentence appears to have been copied directly from Merriam Webster, a respectable dictionary. ""Definition of shearling: skin from a recently sheared sheep or lamb that has been tanned and dressed with the wool left on."" I've bought shearling slippers before, and this accurately describes they were made of: sheepskin with the wool left on. That's what I was looking for. The title and product description of these Tamarac slippers naturally led me to assume that ""shearling slippers"" is what I was purchasing this time, too.Are these Tamarac slippers actually made of shearling? Alas, no. But because of the deceptive title and descriptive, you might not realize that until you've already bought them and inspected them closely. The lining is actually some sort of woven wool that has been glued to a suede backing. It's FAKE shearling. Or we can be fancy and call it ""faux."" But it is not real shearling. If you want shearling slippers, look elsewhere. I'm annoyed because I didn't discover this until I had already worn them a little, at which point I didn't think I could return them. I guess I should have combed through the reviews more carefully, because some other people were saying the same thing.Are they decent slippers anyway? Sure, I guess. I'm so annoyed about the deceptive advertising that they will never be my favorite. Every time I look at them, I just see FAKE shearling. The lining does claim to be made of real wool at least, though at this point, who knows? They're warm enough, though they don't fit quite as comfortably on my foot as some other slippers I've owned. They're a little wider than they need to be, so they don't feel very snug on the foot. I find them more comfortable with the ruff turned up, though then they start pulling down my socks at the heel. I usually find myself switching to my old slippers eventually. I'm also annoyed that there was a big plastic label on both soles that I couldn't take off without leaving such a sticky residue that the slippers stuck to the floor with every step.So in the end I'm giving these two stars, having docked one for each major annoyance: (1) FAKE shearling, (2) pull down my socks, (3) annoying sticky labels on the bottom.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"*UPDATED*I originally gave 2 stars. However, I have now dropped it to 1 star. After sending back the first 2 I purchased because the sizing was WAY off I reordered even before being refunded. Now again I will be returning. This time just one of them, but none the less it's a real inconvenience.1st. I ordered a navy and ash shirt. The navy color was as expected. The ash on the other hand was not ash it was very light heather grey. Tag shows ""Ash"" it is clearly heather.2nd. They are still big for being ""Small"" the navy shirt made in Honduras seems to be closest to the medium shirts I normally wear hopefully after a wash it shrinks.The ""Ash"" shirt seems like a large/extra large and again is heather grey made. This one made in Haiti. It's not the fit I wanted nor the color so I will be returning AGAIN.Overall my rating is based on experience as well as the fit and product description.*ORIGINAL POST*2 stars because, the 2 I ordered were massive. I ordered medium size shirts and got medium size shirts according to the tag. All the shirts and even jackets I own are medium size. They were more like large maybe even XL in size. I returned them and ordered the small. Crossing my fingers that they fit otherwise returning them also. The hassle to return something and wait for a refund is the reason it got 2 stars.

This review is 100% only on the actual company these boots are sold by BareBones WorkWear since I have yet to receive my order. I ordered these boots on 12/3 for my son for Christmas - he loves cowboy boots and totally worn his old pair out so these looked like a great choice for him. According to the original order after having to pay for shipping I received notification that the item would ship between 12/7-12/10 with an estimated delivery date of 12/12-12/17. On 12/18 after not receiving I went online with Amazon and selected contact seller sent email and waited for a response. On 12/19 I still had not heard so I emailed another time. After not hearing again I tried to call them several times. I finally was able to talk to someone at Barebones who told me they had a glitch in their computer and several orders never went thru mine included. She said she would process the order but it would not be received by Christmas - the best they could do is 3 day shipping and that would be after the 24-48 hrs it would take for the warehouse to get the order ready. So I asked why it couldn't be overnighted?? And get this - they could not overnight because the shiping charge would end up costing them more than the item itself HAHA SERIOUSLY --- that is so not my problem. I think they owe it to there customers to make the situation right given that they could still get that gift to us so it could be under the tree by Christmas. Thanks for listening to me vent. Hope this doesn't reflect on how the quality of the boots are since their customer service has little to be desired. Oh I forgot to mention - they did offer to remove my shipping charges -- still doesn't fix the issue!!!,Product Issue,Product Issue

"This bead is of inferior quality. Not the brilliant silver displayed, but more of a pewter color. It looks totally out of place next to real Pandora beads.Also, Pugster is the WORST vendor I've ever dealt with on Amazon. There were multiple problems with my order. First, my items were not shipped until WELL after the estimated delivery date. Only after I inquired about my order, was it shipped. On top of that, several days later I received an email saying that Pugster had no control over shipping, and I should wait 10 days before asking for a status. No apology for the delay; only an attempt to shift blame to the USPS. Very irritating because I have the email proving they waited over 2 weeks to ship my order with no correspondence as to why. Furthermore, my problem wasn't even related to shipping speed. Rather, my problem was that Pugster DIDN'T SHIP IT. Once it shipped, the USPS delivered it quickly. To me, that shows a lack of integrity when a company tries to shift blame to someone else. I would have been okay with the delay, if Pugster would have been honest.Further, once the package arrived, there was an item missing. The invoice listed the item, with a check mark next to it. There was no explaination as to why it was missing, nor when I could expect it. I emailed 48 hours ago, and still no response. DO NOT do business with Pugster - deceptive vendor.",Product Issue,Product Issue
"I would rate these higher because the shapers themselves are great and very comfortable, were it not for the terrible customer service I have received since ordering mine. I am not the type of customer to complain or return items unless absolutely necessary, but I will be returning these purely due to MM's customer service and will instead buy another pair from a different company.I ordered these on a Wednesday morning and paid for expedited 2-day shipping ($16 in shipping on a $17 item) because I needed them ASAP for an event the following Sunday. I received an email 2 days later on Friday letting me know that they had been shipped the previous day via USPS and that my estimated delivery date was the following Wednesday--a full WEEK after I had placed the order and paid for 2-day shipping. I wrote back to MM letting them know that this was unacceptable and that I would be returning the item upon arrival.My response from MM was a generic response beginning with ""Dear Customer"" on the name line. Now, I've worked in customer service jobs before where we've had the pre-packaged responses to send to customers, but we at least had the decency to put their name on the top line. But I digress. To sum up the response, they said that shipping is 2 BUSINESS days and that my item should arrive by Monday, not Wednesday. Funny, when I go onto the USPS website to track said item, my delivery date is still Wednesday. Furthermore, USPS does run on Saturdays, so my item realistically should have arrived by the Saturday after ordering.Long story short, this is the last item I will ever purchase from Motherhood Maternity, for either myself or anyone else. I will spend my day today in between everything else I already had planned to get done, somehow trying to find a replacement for these so that I have something to wear in time for tomorrow. I am greatly disappointed in MM, and sad to have had to write my first negative review on here. If it helps someone else thinking of purchasing from MM, or if it helps to improve MM's customer service at all (not likely), then I'm happy to have written it.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"I have been using this watch for over 4 months and will not recommend buying this one. Here are my honest views about this watch:________Positive:________ Stainless steel frame and even chain/bracelet (not an electroplated fake finish), Chronograph(mine started malfunctioning from first use) and Waterproof Radium coated glow in the dark needles and time marks Looks like a Rolex copy________Negative:________ Very poor warranty If you need to get it serviced/repaired even under the warranty, you will need to spend good amount of money in shipping back and forth cost out of your pocket, probably almost half the cost of the watch. From the first use of chronograph itself it started malfunctioning. The Hour needle of chronograph never stops/reset. It was gifted to me, so neither I can directly reach out to the buyer to return the product on Amazon nor I want to spend any money on the shipping cost for the servicing under warranty Its time setting needle/pin is quite thick and sticks too much out of the frame. It pokes/tweaks into my hand and long use always leaves a mark. Which makes it pretty uncomfortable to wear. - See the attached picture Although it does looks elegant but honestly, after using, to me it seems like cheaply made in China quality either under 5 or definitely just under 10 bucks!__________Conclusion:__________If you are looking for something affordable, don't go for this good looking but cheap quality product. Rather do yourself a favor by either spending more to buy something better or go with probably Casio or some other affordable yet reliable brands rather than wasting your money on this watch.PS: If this review was helpful to you in any way, pleas vote Yes/helpful",Product Issue,Product Issue

"Bought these as a replacement for a worn out pair for my husband as a gift. The ones I bought a few years ago were directly from the adidas website and everything we expected. The new pair from Amazon almost seems fake. The color on the sole isn't the traditional ""gum"" color, but more of a purple. And the sole is a much harder smooth material than the last pair. The new ones are also lighter weight than the old ones. They just seem off. The suede looks old and has a blue/grey tint to it. And the stitching is off. He's super disappointed so I'm going to attempt to return and then buy directly from adidas again. I have a hard time believing the quality has gone down that bad in just a few years. I checked the serial numbers and the old pair has consecutive numbers, and even though the new ones aren't the same (easy way to spot fake), they are a few hundred digits away from each other. Don't buy these from Amazon if you've been wearing this shoe for years and you expect the same quality. I've attached photos comparing them to the old ones.",Product Issue,Product Issue

These are not authentic Ray Ban sunglasses. I received them and one of the arms (temple) was really hard to unfold and the other one opened easily like it should. I didn't think Ray Ban would send out their product like this so I went to Nordstrom and bought at pair to compare. After comparing I noticed the logo had much different thickness in the print as well as the engraved RB initial on the other lens looked completely different and the nose pieces on the Nordstrom pair were flesh colored and these were clear. The other thing I noticed is the back side of the lens had a different coating. Clearly too many differences compared to the ones purchased from a legit company for me to believe these are authentic. If you really want real Ray Ban sunglasses don't buy these. I'm sure fake ones can be had for much less money.,Product Issue,Product Issue
"First of all, I want to mention the name of the seller who sold me this product. GAFFOSI don't understand how this seller have this good rating!!!...They sent me a superb quality fake product. First of all they took the price of the polarized version but sent me a regular version. Moreover that is a fake one. The product failed at least 4 counterfeit buster features.I am using Ray-Ban for more than 9 years. As soon as I saw the Ray-ban logo on the glass I felt I bit uncomfortable but could not identify the problem with that. A closer look revealed the actual story. In the Ray-Ban logo the head of the letter ' R ' starts with thick edge and then becomes a bit thinner. But, the product I got, there the head of the letter ' R ' was equally thing through out its length. And the print is also slightly larger if I am not wrong.Later I found the followings:1) It did not have the square shaped sticker bar-code on the paper box.2) In the nose shoe there is no 'R.B' rather there is 'R B' and the seller intentionally scratched the noes shoe so that it become unreadable.3) In the left leg part of the white print is already gone.4) Moreover, I am writing about a feature. May be this is not correct cause I could not find this feature over internet but discovered myself.  I have 4 pairs of Ray Ban's in all of them in one nose shoe in printed in inverted alignment with the other. But the product I got, that has both in same alignment.

"My local  store had the same model for $195 + tax.  Not knowing Amazon sold these for less I bought one from the local store. The glasses had a very nice feeling to them but still out of curiosity I checked them for being genuine - the RB marks, the inside of the temple for product name font, the nose pads and those gave me no reason to doubt at all.But then there's my wife - in order to make me look a hasty and less intelligent person (kidding), she went on Amazon and found the  exact same pair for $85 taxes included. After the usual research on the seller (I make it a point not to buy from 3rd parties on Amazon if there is an option of buying direct from Amazon - mostly due to bad experiences in the past.) we decided it was a great deal and we could buy two of them.The pair arrived fast as  usual. But then as I took it out of the packaging I started noticing oddities. Both the boxes had strange markings - like oil smudges but not really. Ignoring that I took out one of them and my wife the other. On the one I picked out - one hinge was looking like it was blackened a bit. Looking closely I noticed a lot of very short hair type dust all over. I said no big deal let's wipe and move along.  But then doing my fake check I noticed two issues  on the one I was looking at. First was that the inside of temple where they write RAY BAN RB3025 etc in white typeface - that wasn't white enough and the 5 in the 3025 was scratched, making it look like, well not 5. The second issue was that on mine, the nose pads were not aligned equally - one had wider gap between it and the rim than the other. I also noticed a white dot on the outside of the temple one one side. Not good.On the one my wife picked, everything appeared OK but there was another difference - her's had a plastic wrapping around one temple that mine did not!Given all these things we decided there wasn't a way to be reasonably sure if these were genuine. They definitely did not feel like the one from the store did and had all these inconsistencies that made them look like well made fakes - but on the other hand  since we explicitly bought it direct from Amazon and some comment mentions they are an authorized Ray Ban dealer - I was confused as to how this could happen - may be Ray Ban has QA issues?So we ended up returning both - I am giving them two stars just because how easy Amazon's return process is. I would suggest being careful about these even if you do buy direct from Amazon.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"I had to return these boots twice. The first time it was because the size I purchased was too small. The second time was because of a defect in the boot. The pull was attached inside at an angle which meant the leather underneath the tab (what the tab is attached to) was sticking out and scratching my calf, also that piece underneath had mesh fabric glued on, the kind you see on underneath fake leather (I'm not saying it was fake, I honestly didn't look too hard). The sole was attached sloppily in obvious layers with unglued pieces sticking out, it looked awful. After the second return I decided to get a refund and drive over and get them at Boot Barn. I looked at the same boots and noticed some pretty obvious and disturbing differences. The boots I got from Amazon had no square Frye patches sewn inside over both pull straps plus the online pull straps were longer. The sole of these boots were not layered like the mail order boots, it has one piece of leather above a thick sole of oil resistant rubber. The quality is outstanding and defect free. Also the Frye logo is in a different spot and angled not straight up and down like the online pair. I checked three pair of boots and they were identical with regard to placement, etc. The harness strap is also longer, it doesn't go around the ankle like the Amazon pair. Instead it falls about 3/4"" above the heel, the new boots weigh much less with much softer, more flexible cowhide. The online also didn't come in a Frye box (not sure this matters since Boot Barn just puts them in one of their store bags, no box at all). I'm not usually a whiner and I don't think I've ever given a one star review, or one this long. But I've been buying Frye's since I was in high school and that's about forty years. I've got five pair now, the oldest is twenty-five, they last forever, I just resole them, clean them up and they're right as rain. So maybe Amazon's are the real thing and it's just coincidence that I just got two lousy pair, or maybe they were the real thing but the price was good because they're seconds, or maybe they're counterfeit. I posted pics of my new ones for comparison.",Product Issue,Product Issue
I've been a loyal Levi customer since I was in my teens and this was the first time I've bought online because I knew exactly why I want and I only own Levi jeans.After trying them on the material feels very thin and flimsy and they do not fit like any of my other 513s.

I was skeptical of purchasing these because I was afraid they may be fake. I thought that because they were coming from Zappos they would be real so I figured I'd try it. Luckily I was only buying to replace a worn out pair I already have which I bought at an official ugg retail store. I scanned the QR code on my old ones to know what too look for in the new ones. It took me right to the ugg website and said that they were authentic. When these arrived in the mail I was automatically concerned. The box didn't seem heavy enough and it was rather small. When I took the ugg box out I was right in my concerns the ugg box was a lot smaller than the uggs I have gotten in the past. Then when I took the boot out they were not as heavy as my uggs and the fur was completely different they looked like walmart brand boots but with the ugg label. So just to be sure of what i already knew I scanned the QR code and nothing came up except a link that I could google. So what I knew was proven to be true. Beware of anything you buy off Amazon. And this is strange to me because Zappos is selling fake shoes so beware of Zappos too I guess.,Product Issue,Product Issue

"I have owned Ugg boots in the past and have been so pleased with the quality and warmth of the shearling fur.  Therefore, I was quite surprised when I received these boots and found the fur on the visible cuff that also is used in the upper two thirds of the inner boot lining to be fake and not real shearling.I reread the description and now notice the only shearling in the boot is the on the removable foot bed liner (which is real shearling but the fur is trimmed to approximately 1/4"").For this price, I did expect the long fur shown in the photos to be real fur and not fake plastic fur.  The boots, therefore, do not keep me warm as authentic shearling would.  Sending them back.  I can get boots with fake fur for a much cheaper price than $240.Not sure why Ugg would cut major corners like this when their real shearling boots are why most people purchase their products.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"My nephew requested a pair of 12 hole boots for Christmas and I was delighted to buy them. Great taste! I was confused at first why they were the same price I paid in 1983 and then realized, sadly, that much of the production had shifted to Thailand. I find it deeply disturbing when iconic brands leave their country of origin. I offered to buy him the real thing but they didn't have a big enough boot for his large feet. I bought the cheaper made-in-Thailand version instead and we were frankly, disgusted when they arrived. They were of very poor quality with unacceptable leather. These stink. Luckily, they were too big so we were able to purchase a very nice pair made in England. Don't buy these. Either don't buy them at all or buy the England-made version. What junk.My niece requested Ugg boots and my mom ordered a pair at a discount. Lousy taste! When they arrived, it was clearly a Chinese fraudulent swindle.

"I've been buying these Propet Scandia Walker men's shoes for years, so I have a lot of experience with this shoe.  I always buy 10 1/2 XE (US 3 E) and they have always been GREAT, until I bought these 2 pair from Elite Hero.  I always bought them before from a major US retailer, but they didn't have them anymore.  The difference was astonishing.  They were very TIGHT, and the materials looked inferior (but not enough that I can initially cry foul, the proof should come with wearing).  Also the leather upper is VERY hard on these now.  Elite Hero has assured me that Propet has told them that Propet had not lowered the quality of the shoes (one of my first concerns along with were they knock-offs i.e. fakes).  I have contacted Propet 3 times, but have not received a reply yet.  Another question that I have, is since they are China made and other Companies have complained of Chinese manufacturing NOT putting in the specified materials, could there be a manufacturer issue.  Specifically has the manufacturer, without Propet knowledge or approval, changed the materials or shorted the materials (e.g. smaller than specified shoe size) to save on cost and improve profit?  The leather upper is now VERY hard, the sole appears to be of similar material as before, but inferior.  And there's the tight fit.",Product Issue,Product Issue
"I have had about 15 pair of these exact shoes in my life.  They wear out every 6 months or so and I replace them.  The pair I had before these were great!  I had purchased them at an actual Merrell store at the Tanger Outlet in Iowa.  The pair before that were awful.  I had bought them at Scheels and the left shoe was larger than the right and my foot slide around.  I took a chance and bought these via Amazon.  The arch in the right foot is so high and uncomfortable that I wore them for a week and started getting shin splints in my right leg.  Something is not right about this pair of shoes.  So, this past weekend, I went to the Merrell Store at the Tanger Outlet and bought another pair, and they work great!  I have a serious concern that the item being sold here, may be a fake, or that Amazon and Scheels get the class B shoe, and the Merrell store gest the Class A.  Anyways, Merrell shoes are awesome, this shoe is awesome, I just don't think you should buy it here.  Go to a Merrell store direct if you can!",Product Issue,Product Issue
"This product was a disappointment for me because it looks obviously fake and you can obviously see that it is plastic.  The arrows are not even long enough, the tips are made of a flimsy foam, and the ends of the arrows are not notched so you can't even pretend to hook them on to the string of the bow ---  so in short, it is not realistic in any way but ok if you are desperate enough to use as a bad prop for Halloween.  I wish these companies would make better items for fans of LOTR!  However, I did receive this item quickly from the Costume Hub, thru Amazon, and it was well packaged, so I have no complaints with them!",Product Issue,Product Issue

"UPDATE: I hate it because of what it was and now what it is. I bought the necklace years ago, and it was my absolute favorite necklace. I wore it constantly. It was GORGEOUS. I accidentally stepped on it and had to reorder a replacement. It's AWFUL in comparison. It's smaller, not curved, the tines are not rounded - it's just a cheap, flat, smaller fake design of what its former self was. I'm so disappointed. The cost is double for a truly poor imitation. Not recommended until the manufacture goes back to producing quality work.Previous Review: I got the necklace and immediately put it on, and have received compliments from men and women. It's a very modern and different piece that should go with just about every style, and it dresses up almost anything.The necklace is very light, bright silver (someone called it ""very new looking""). It would be amazing on luminous skin. As other customers have stated, the pendant is large - the size of a 50-cent piece - and sturdy. The chain is serpentine and delicate, and probably prone to damage. I imagine it will eventually have to be replaced, especially if I continue to wear it as much as I have.Overall, a fabulous accessory.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"I bought this ring to replace my real diamond wedding band, to wear for everyday use. When I first took it out of the box I was amazed at how real it looks and feels. It's a fairly weighted ring, does not feel cheap. Once I put it on, I fell in LOVE with it! I actually like it better than my real ring! I have read other reviews that say the center diamond is to small or set low, but in my opinion, thats what I love about it the most, it gives it this modest yet expensive look. I didn't want a fake ring that looked to unreal for me to be wearing or too REAL that I get mugged!

"I normally don't bother writing negative product reviews, but I had to express my special disappointment for this watch.

My 2 main gripes with this watch are:1.  The fake crocodile leather strap LOOKS incredibly fake.  The ""grains"" aren't even indented in the leather, they are just dyed on.  In the product picture, it looks like there are indents in the leather, which would make it at least somewhat of a passable fake crocodile leather strap.  I'd be perfectly happy with a regular leather strap, given that a genuine crocodile strap at this price would not be reasonable to ask for, but alas.2.  The bezel is supposedly made out of titanium, but it feels like plastic.  Its weight, it's turning feel, and the looseness make it look and feel ridiculously cheap.I would expect issues like this from a $25-40 watch.  Not that $240 is expensive for a watch, but you should be able to expect more for this price.",Product Issue,Product Issue

After wearing these shoes out for a day, I knew something was wrong.  They killed my feet, and could not be NB.  Sure enough, I looked the shoes up on the NB website and the picture of the top of the shoes is different from the shoes I received.  Also, the ""N"" on the side of the shoe is raised (it should be flush), and the edges are rough like it was sewn on after the shoe was made.  These are counterfeit shoes.

I wear an 11W and the boots felt good when I first began work for the day.  I never get (up until this boot) blisters on my feet.  About two weeks went by and with a healed heal I tried again.  It was then that I noticed the  boots are defective and the stitching down the back is raised on the right boot.  I had worn two pairs of socks but could feel the seam rubbing the back of my heal.

"I initially loved this wallet- but really what I loved is my ORIGINAL Hobo from 10 years ago- so after recent news on this- I have edited my review.I have had a Hobo Lauren wallet for going on 10 years now, and I absolutely love it! It's held up and looks great still after YEARS OF DAILY USE.I purchased this wallet here on Amazon for a friend this time around, same price as my last, and shows that it ships from Hobo directly. When I got the wallet in, it wasn't packaged as well as I remember (literally wrapped in plastic like a $10 wallet would be) but I wrapped it and gifted it anyway. That was in January of this year.I recently just last week happened to see my friend while she was in town and was HORRIFIED to see her wallet and it's condition- and mind you, she actually told me she just started using it in September, not January when I gave it to her, after the change of season. The ""leather"" (I put it in quotes because I've never seen real leather wear this quickly) has already started peeling off. As I looked closer, and compared it to my 10 year old Hobo, there are many details that I found that really make me feel that A) this is 100% a fake Hobo Or B) Hobo has dramatically and horribly lowered the quality of their products and textiles.I'm sick to my stomach to think that I spent $110 on a wallet that hasn't even lasted a couple of months, when I specifically invested that money thinking it would last her a decade like it did me. I'm more disgusted that I can't return it through Amazon due to it being a gift and me not knowing the condition, however I will be filing a formal complaint.Also, to lable this is a ""vintage"" Hobo when it is clearly not, is a BAIT AND SWITCH.",Seller Issue,Product Issue
"I guess I'm the sucker, because these are horrible!!  I've been meaning to give these a bad review since the third week I had them, and they've only gotten worse.The lenses do not have the crystal clear vision I get with other polarized glasses. Even worse, they scratch if you look through them sideways. I am a photographer and very careful about how I handle and clean my glasses, but these got scratched up right away.The frames are made of some sort of plastic that reacts to sweat, so the temples are always covered with a white crud that is impossible to  get off. I finally quit trying. They lasted less than three months before they were ugly pieces of junk.Ray Bans and Serengetis last me for years, as did my old pair of Oakleys, years ago. Not these. In fact, I now routinely reach for the 10-year old Serengetis these were supposed to replace -- because they are in better shape than these Oakleys, even though both pairs get the exact same treatment.Either these are fake, or this company has seriously gone down hill. I can't imagine knock-offs performing any worse than these.I was going to replace the lenses and put up with the ugly frames -- figuring I would use them for work and stuff. But the replacement lenses from Oakley cost more than these glasses.Bottom line, they're Oakleys, so if you want glasses to impress other people, these will do it. If you want glasses that will impress you, I suggest you look elsewhere.These also have an odd fit. They are a bit wide for me at the face, but the temples squeeze my head hard enough to become uncomfortable after an hour or so. I'm going to take the blame for that, maybe I just have an oddly shaped head. But, again, this was never a problem with previous sunglasses I have owned.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"I have owned two pairs of these Professional Cabrio Clogs-- one a beautiful brown color and the other a rich cordovan color. First of all, let me say that the leather is some of the best quality that I have ever seen in a shoe. It takes and keeps its shine quite well. Some do not like the appearance of these clogs, but I think they look great with jeans and they can also be worn in a more dressy professional atmosphere. I teach and I wear them in the classroom with dress pants. I have received many compliments on how they look. However, that is where my praise for this product ends. I found these shoes to be probably the most uncomfortable shoe I have ever worn. The European sizing in these shoes present a problem. I do not believe it is true to size. I ordered the largest size available on line - a European size 47 and they were very tight across the instep and did not slide up and down on the heel as they are supposed to in order to have a comfort fit. The size 47 is supposed to translate into a 13 1/2 to 14 in U.S. men's sizes -- However I wear a size 13 or 13 wide shoe normally and they fit great but these clogs were quite a bit smaller and tighter. These shoes felt more like a narrow size 12. If you have any type of wide foot, be careful ordering this shoe. I did see that Amazon is now carrying this Dansko Clog in a wide fit. I may try one of those. I did order both pairs of shoes on line. The brown pair was made in Poland and the cordovan pair was made in China (I think). They were guaranteed to be genuine. I hope I didn't get a ""knock down"" fake. I don't think so, because of the fine quality leather found in the shoe. Be careful when ordering these clogs on line. They do not seem to be true to size. They definitely run on the narrow side. Consider ordering the new wide style if your feet are even a slight bit wide.",Seller Issue,Product Issue

"So, I got this watch as a graduation gift back in March of 2012. It was brand new and I loved it due to the fact that it looked a lot like the Rolex Submariner. Since then it has been my primary watch I wear 24/7. Recently though, (back in June 2013) The wristband broke and Invicta wanted me to pay for shipping AND any parts that they would need to replace. I took it to my local jeweler and they had to reset the band for 10 bucks. While I was there he pointed out what I had always thought was a scratch on the back mineral. He said that it was a hair inside the casing. Now I have owned the watch since it was brand new and NEVER opened the case in its lifetime. He offered to take it out for free but it would destroy the seal for diving. I declined the offer and opted to call Invicta and see what they would do. Once again, they wanted me to send them the watch, pay for shipping, and pay for any repairs that they would do. O, and wait at a minimum of three months to get it back! And this was something that I didn't even do. It was a flaw that happened while it was being made. So I don't think so, I'll save my money for a different watch. The hair hadn't affected watch before, so i left it. Now a month or so later, the bezel fell off the watch. I'm done with Invicta. I really like the watch and it keeps great time, but due to the way it has fallen apart in a year and Invicta's customer service, I think I am going to try a different brand. Maybe Nautica. I've had Timex, Casio and fake Rolexes hold up better than this. So DO NOT BUY! (Also just a side note, the gold is plated and comes off after some time.)",Product Issue,Product Issue

"These are fakes--I have a pair of Birkenstocks that are 4 years old and totally fine, but this pair's cork heel started tearing off after no more than 2 months of wear. I would not repurchase them from this seller.",Seller Issue,Product Issue
"I've worn Birkenstocks for over 2 decades, I know how they fit, work, wear, and last. With this particular pair, the quality is exceptionally poor. Less than a year I have had them and the sole has already worn into the cork. My use has been fairly regular, but casual. Not daily usage, and definitely not constant; with the majority of the use being simple walks around the block (less than a mile at a time), etc. If my usage were heavy I'd understand, but when previous pairs would be worn for years before such wear showed, I must say I am greatly saddened. I don't know if it is because of the recent popularity in Birkenstocks that quality has been diminished with increased production, or perhaps this was a fraudulent pair, as so much has been said of fakes being sold on Amazon. Either way, it was a disappointing purchase in a brand I have trusted for most of my life.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"I absolutely love the look of the watch so I tried to purchase this watch from two Internet dealers, once from this Amazon merchant and once from Jomashop. And upon close inspection, both of them are the high-end AAA replicas made from China!!!So I am going to vote this 1 star just remind everyone - please choose another model if you don't want to pay $300 for a fake made in China!It's none of the faults of Tissot, or Amazon, or even the Internet dealers... it's just that Tissot is a very popular brand in China and PRC200 has been on the market for a very long time - giving plenty of time for the Chinese to perfect their replica.It's staggering that I did a PRC200 search on the Chinese equivalent of eBay, there are thousands of fakes ranging from $60 USD to $150 USD. The ones I received are the AAA $150 one with the authentic Swiss quartz movement, but the build quality of the dials and bracelet is still a bit worse than the original Tissot.It's shocking how the current market is flooded by replicas that I suspect the majority of the gray market PRC200 in US is fake. Because the movement is authentic, no Authorized Dealer will be willing to tell you that it's a fake, so we are completely at our digression here. I think even one of the images posted by Amazon customers on this page is fake, because you can see that the tachymeter is slightly out of position.I ended up buying a Swiss Army watch... purely based on the conclusion that there are no high-end replicas for that model yet because it just came out last year.Good luck everyone!",Product Issue,Product Issue

The actual glasses felt sturdy, but the arms were a dead giveaway that these were a knockoff. Not only did they not open evenly (one side opened beyond the width of the front of the frames, while the other stopped at the edge of the front like it's supposed to), but each arm was a different shape!

"These shoes are fake! After being skeptical from reading the already not so great reviews, I did my research as soon as I received them. Naturally, they said ""Made in Dominican Republic"" and the size was hand written on them in pen, which I was afraid of. Right away, I emailed the Jack Rogers company (not Amazon dealer) and asked what they thought. They said ""this is how we make our shoes AS OF NOW"", which they are basically saying they are outsourcing and using cheaper materials behind the backs of their customers who still believe they are ""Jack Rogers USA"" ... how can you call yourself that if your shoes are blatantly stamped with something contradicting that? Either Jack Rogers thinks we are stupid, or they are.  ALSO, my friend bought a pair of ""authentic"" Jack Rogers from Dillards for $130. I saw them and they were so obviously fake, had ""Made in Dominican Republic"" stamped on them, and were RIPPING 3 months after she purchased them. Jack Rogers is scamming us. They think they can change their whole production process behind our backs without us finding out. I hope they get caught before many more people waste their hard earned money thinking they are buying high quality shoes from a ""reliable"" company.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"Okay, unless you didn't know, there are three different kind of Docs. There are the ones made at the UK factory (they are $180.00 or more), there are these (which are made in China), and there are ones made in Taiwan. Even Journey's sells the ones made in Asia so don't think you're getting ripped off. However, I want you to know all this before you order. There is a reason you're not paying $180+ for these. They are made in a factory, they are not hand made, and the leather patent and not genuine. With all that being said, I did a lot of research before I ordered them and found many people prefer the Made in China Docs these days. You should know that all Docs are an absolute pain in the arse to break in and Upton Sinclair said it best -- THERE WILL BE BLOOD. Get the care kit online or from Journey's and use it. Keep your boots stuffed with newspaper when you're not wearing them and wear two pairs of socks. Also, a comment on the fit. I wear and 8 and I needed an 8. They were true to size for me.EDIT: I'm coming back after three after purchase and wearing these to update my review. I don't like these. I've been wearing them for years and still waiting for them to be broken in and become comfortable enough for daily wear. They're not. The fake patent leather is still super stiff and they still give me blisters.

We will not order these from Amazon again unless there is some reassurance they are the real thing. The picture is correct, the shoes, sadly, were not.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"Bought these boots from Shoe Parlor and the only problem i've had with these boots is with the quality - the inner linning to be more specific. After 6 months it started to develop mold/mildew in the inside of the boot due to the poor quality of the material used of the inner linning - it keeps moisture for a long time and doesn't leave the leather to breath !!!I've kept and stored the boots in good condition as specified by the manufacturer. I have a pair of Frye Boots as well which were bought, used and stored together with the Timberland boots in the same enviroment and conditions - the Frye boots are in perfect condition but the Timberland boots have developed mold/mildew, which i cannot get rid of it even after trying all sort of mold/mildew removal solutions.Due to this problem the inner linning has started  to disintegrate and if the mold will spread to the outer leather layer, then i will need throw the boots away.I am hugely disappointed with with the seller's attitude and lack of cooperation and with the quality of the product - which is unacceptable for Timberland products - maybe they were fake !",Product Issue,Product Issue

I also made an additional trip to the mall to look at another pair from this year, as mine are from last year.  They are definitely FAKE!  (I'd post details, but then the manufacturer could fix their fakes so include less flaws to trick you even more.)  If you want the real deal then buy from Dillards or Nordstrom.

Toms are comfortable and very light though.  They are just as fake as Whole Foods, and ironically I hear you can get these there.  If you really want to be good for the world, shop at your local food co-op or farmers market and as stereotypical as they are, save up and get some Birkenstocks.

So, I ordered the same style from the Toms website and compared the two shoes side-by-side to make sure. The bottoms are COMPLETELY different. This may be the only indication that they're fake Toms, but it's a big difference. After all, what good is a shoe if it's so slippery you can barely walk? DO NOT ORDER!

The TOMS I received were almost identical to authentic  TOMS, but luckily I did some research and discovered that mine were fake. TOMS typically run a little large and I wear a size 7 in normal shoes, but the 7 I received was way too tight! Real TOMS also have their signature arch and stitched in sole, but my soles were completely flat and glued on! After I removed my foot from trying it on, the entire sole came off... the glue they use isn't even good quality! The box it came in also had really bad printing.. somebody was using a sharpie or something to write in the print! The printing on the box looked like it was handwritten.. And fyi, my seller was BLINQ. I called them and said that I had received a pair of fake TOMS, and hey told me that I probably got a bad pair and that the TOMS they sell are 100% authentic. Don't trust them!

"The look and feel of this watch are great, but the one I purchased was a mechanical wreck and needed service immediately after I bought it. The date changed every 36 to 48 hours and was horrifically inconsistent, among other things.It's a *VERY BAD SIGN* when a company like Tag Heuer allows a watch to leave their factory in such bad mechanical condition. People who don't care about the mechanics of a watch can go buy a fake Rolex, but for those of you who do care about such things, think twice before purchasing this watch.*NEW UPDATE 5 YEARS AFTER PURCHASE*I wound up purchasing another identical watch after returning my original mechanical wreck. The second watch has been gently handled for 5 years and I experienced no problems with it beyond the expected battery replacements until last week when the crown FELL OFF while changing the date/time. I was told that it would cost a whopping $350 to replace the crown.Now that the crown is off, it's clear that Tag has a design flaw. The crowns needn't be so large and would be better off being half the size so they're more protected by the surrounding flanges. By making them as large as they are for this model, normal wear will likely cause a break.It's ridiculous that a watch considered to be a ""fine Swiss time piece"" can't handle normal wear while a basic $50 sport watch easily lasts 10-15 years with zero problems.Buyer beware for Tag.",Product Issue,Product Issue

"Worst Timberland's EVER!! I've owned a lot of Timberland's in my life, some I still have that are 20+ years old, but these had to have been imitation knockoffs. The leather started flaking, yes flaking, away just after a couple of months. The leather at the creases near the toes literally shredded into gouges. The insoles ripped in different directions. These boots were not cheap either. They were the same price at the local stores. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for a friend as a Christmas gift. Two different people, two different with environments, yet still both pair fell to shreds within months. I would never buy shoes online from sellers on Amazon ever again because you never know what you're getting. Yes, they had the Timberland logo on them and even came in a Timberland box, but either these were fakes or the quality of Timberland boots have gone to the pits.

Also, the packaging was ridiculous.  No where on the Amazon ad was there a mention that this particular ""sheriff's badge"" was for a ""sexy sheriff"" costume.  However, when I received it from the seller, the packaging was covered with ""sexy sheriff"" in pics & wording.  Disgusting!  I, of course, tossed the packaging immediately & never showed it to my daughter.  The badge itself is small, as I stated previously, but it's a normal fake sheriff's badge in every other way-- it doesn't scream ""sexy"" like the packaging did.  All in all, it will work, but I wouldn't have purchased this particular piece if I'd known the packaging was covered with controversial material.

This started up about a month after I got them, not too bad, but noticeable. ""Eh, it'll go away,"" I thought. No it did not. Instead, it got steadily worse, both shoes.

But now...all of sudden, their shoes are getting to be of poor quality.  I think they have become too successful.  I already have 2 pairs of relatively new shoes from Merrell that are falling apart.  I now use one pair that is falling apart and do yard work only....and they are terrible.  I have a second pair that is falling apart and relatively new.  I have spend lots of $100 on Merrell shoes.  I am so disappointed that I have moved to different brands.  I was going to buy the above shoe but told myself that I should not.  As far as I am concerned....they were a 5 and now a 1.  What a shame.............",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

Can't rate this very well only because they were too small so my husband couldn't actually wear them. The size runs small. Given the right size for him I'd say they would have been a good boot for him.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I ordered these boots on 11 April 2015, and received them by 14 April. Since that time, I have worn them frequently, finding them comfortable and true-to-size, and I had believed them to be durable.However, I noticed today (10 November 2015) that the stitching on the soles is failing. This is piss-poor performance for a boot from a respected maker - even if I were wearing them every single day (which I've not been), a seven month lifespan on the sole stitching is pathetic.It's possible that the pair I got is defective, but after seeing so many other customers with exactly the same complaint, I think it more likely that this is simply the standard Justin builds to now. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone - if you're willing to live with mediocre boots, they can be had far cheaper.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The boot was suppose to be 2E in with but they were to tight.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I ordered the 2E width and immediately found them very tight.  I initially ascribed the tightness to a need to ""break-in"" these boots.  Half-way through the break-in day (I wore them around the house), the junction of the seams, right below the ankle ""broke-i"" all right - in the worst way possible.  This seam junction ended up pressing against the nerve in my foot, making it impossible to keep wearing these boots.

The uppermost inner stitch on the rear part of the elastic protrudes directly thru your socks and into your feet...making them bleed. Forget wearing them without socks. I'm not kidding. Maybe they changed their design or whatever but these are hands down, the worst shoes I've ever purchased. I even tried to clamp/press the offending nubbin flat with a Quick Grip clamp with little success. Perhaps after suffering through a few months of wearing them things will change but so far, one month into wearing them, they deserve the most poorly designed modern shoe award ever. Good penance shoes to go along with a horsehair shirt.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

I bought this shoe after reading all the positive reviews. The shoe itself is very nice but I found the sizing to be way small. The 11.5 fit fine but the D with was way to narrow. I returned the shoes and ordered them in the 2e width. I also found the 2e to be to narrow. I do not have overly wide feet as I wear a D width in all other brands of shoe. I will have to try a different brand of walking shoe that is more true to size.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue

These replaced a pair of Merrill's I have owned for a few years which are blond colored.  They were getting old and I was getting tired of the color.  My old Jungle Moc's are very comfortable to wear.My new black Jungle Moc's seem narrower and tight.  I checked the sizing on my old pair and I ordered the exact same size.

This was a big let down to both me and my partner. Especially because she likes to keep the boxes of her shoes. Overall, the shoes were pretty nice. They had the bright colors we expected, and are not too cheap feeling. The only downside is that the converse logo on the side is not actually made out of the rubber side material, it's just been printed on with plastic, kinda like a t-shirt with a print on it.

First, they were much too large for my son's foot. We ordered a boys 4.5 wide. I wear a women's 6.5. I put them on and they fit with room to spare. They were like boats on my son. Second, the material felt like recycled plastic(fake prooduct). It was very stiff and unyielding to natural movement. Third, there was almost no support in the foot bed. The first thing my son said when he tried them on was, ""These are uncomfortable!"" The only thing that seems to be as it should is that they do appear to be waterproof, although we didn't test them.

The costume quality itself is not the issue. Seems to be decent. The problem is that it appeared to be used and washed. Suspect it was a returned item. The separate articles came wadded up in a twisted ball in the clearly opened packaging. The collar tags were faded and wrinkled. The Velcro closures were curled and covered with white lint balls. There were two snags in the chest area as well. I emailed Amazon on two occasions in an attempt to resolve the matter without a single response. Shame on you Amazon.,Seller Issue,Product Issue

I bought this costume for my 3 year old son's Halloween.  I left it in the package in the box so that NOTHING could happen to it before it was time to wear it.  I should have pulled it out and at least looked at it.  That was my mistake.  When I took it out of the package as we were getting ready the back had runs in the nylon around the behind area and the stitching that held the top and bottom halves together had come apart in the back. It was awful.  What a waste of money.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"My son really likes his costume, since it arrived 2 days ago he's wanted to wear it non-stop. But it's really poorly made.

On calling the manufacturer, I was told that I cannot wear these on a daily basis. They need to rest. Rest? Properly fitting and properly laundered clothing should not need a rest! And, the manufacturer's rep said that if I plan to wear them every day, I need to buy more. Let's see: I wear a suit to work every day and I would need at least 3 pair (about $100) to give the others proper time to rest. Hogwash! Even if I had another pair (or two) they would be equally worn out within 2-3 months, by my calculations.

They did smooth things out and you couldn't really see them under the dress. That being said, they're very uncomfortable and my stomach DID bulge out of the top as others have suggested.

Every pair of pants and shorts I own is a size 34.  I'm not imagining my own size, I'm a size 34.  Dickies, however, sent me a pair of shorts that said they were a size 34, but when I pulled them on, the button was 2-3 inches away from being able to button because they were so small.  I returned them as per their return policy, understanding that I would eat the return shipping cost.  As it turns out, I only got a partial refund: they wouldn't even cover the price to ship the shorts to me!  So I'm just out $16, and there was no way I could have worn the shorts.BEWARE!!!

"I gave this product as many stars as I did merely as a thank-you for the fact that it came in plus size.  Other than that, they had to have been some of the poorest quality stockings I have ever had.  There was nothing ""silk"" about these babies...they were of a very coarse material with inadequate stretch to contour the fit.  They were also overly long for my 5'7"" height.  The lack of stretch meant that this extra material pooled at my ankles in wrinkles.  No amount of pulling them up corrected this problem for very long.  To sum things up:  I am SO grateful that plus sized stockings were available, and at PRIME shipping, too....but Hanes needs to take these back to the drawing board - they didn't spend enough time in beta testing.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I so wanted this bra to be ""the one"", but unfortunately I was very disappointed. First, let me be clear... my breasts are truly a force to behold. I mean, I'm a 38H and it takes a nation of millions to hold them down - or so it seems.  I have had a Freya and Wacoal underwire sports bra that have worked very well in the past, so I know it can be done. When I saw the reviews and the description for this bra, I felt like it might be yet another wonderful one that I could add to the arsenal.  But it was absolutely NOT that bra.  I read tons of reviews regarding the fit and how to measure and I measured myself and purchased a 4.  I was smack in the middle of what should have been a size 4 based on my measurements.  When I received the bra I put it on and the band was obviously the right size, It was difficult to fasten across my breasts - so tight I thought at first it may have been too small, but I was able to fasten the bra and then stuff my breasts into it - maybe not the way they intended to get it on, but hey - whatever works.  When I had it on and positioned my breasts in the cups the first thing I noticed was the significant lack of coverage and spillage out the sides of the bra. I also had monoboob and spillage out of the top. It was just not big enough to contain my breasts. The problem is a size bigger and it would have been way too big in the band.  Also, it had no adjustable straps. I thought it was brand new, and the band was pretty tight, so let me try it out and see how it goes.  So I wore it to my morning workout with my trainer and it was just useless.  It loosens up super fast and I was just bouncing around like a pogo stick. I mean when he said run and give me high knees, he got high breasts too. My breasts were like, ""Seriously?  This is no help at all.""  That's what they said to me after the workout.  I have already worn it so I won't return it.  I guess what I'll do is wear a regular bra under it and wear it on top.  Like so many other times, I end up wearing two bras so as not to waste the money I spent on some inept, unsupportive joke of a bra that my breasts just roll their eyes and shake their head at. Sigh. On to the next.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I bought this brand and Danskin tights to see if there would be a difference in quality (I haven't been big on Hanes, as a brand, before), rather than stock up on a bunch of colors in one brand.I'm glad I did it this way, as I won't buy these again.  They ended up getting a run the very first night I wore them, then they just tore into a hole.For starters, I didn't even like the way they felt.  They didn't stretch well (I have big hips and bought the size supposedly appropriate for me, according to the chart), and they were too snug around my upper thighs, of all places.  It's like they designed it for children's legs.. very runway model, ignoring that women's thighs are typically bigger than their calves.And they were SO THIN, I might as well have shaved and wore nothing.  I bought white because I was hoping to get some white sheer like the picture, but it was nothing like that.  So don't expect these to hide any hair/blemishes you have on your legs, or even look like you're wearing white tights.The only reason I can think of that this gets two stars rather than one is the price and I'm pretty sure they arrived when expected.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"All I wanted to do was wear these for one night and I couldn't even do that with a disaster!!! I am only 5 feet and under the highest weight but decided to buy the largest size just to be safe and be able to put them on easy and not be super tight. Before even getting them on all the way it ripped and in less than 3 seconds it went from the very top all the way down to the ankle!!! I held still while my boyfriend got me some clear nail polish and i put it at the bottom of the rip and the top so that it couldn't get any longer. This worked but not for long. I finally was able to pull them all the way on which took literally 20 minutes because they were so tight and i'm not that big! by the time i walked down the stairs and got into the car, the rip did not get longer but it was now an inch wide almost all the way down! As the day went on It kept getting bigger and bigger. by the end of the day it ended up being about 3 inches wide. My other leg was fine the entire time. They were so incredibly tight that i ended up having to cut them off which was fine since they were so horrible that I would never want to wear them again anyways!!!

"Now, my boobs aren't particularly picky. I can wear most bras and not have a problem. But I cannot understand how anyone can find this bra comfortable. First of all, it looks nothing like it does on the model. It's bulkier and less form-fitting for sure. Just as well, the material used in this bra is really cheap. Now, I've bought cheap bras before, but this one feels like cardboard. I understand it can be hard to find cheap, attractive bras for bigger busted women, but my experience with this one was simply terrible. It also has a huge backstrap which isn't evident in the photos. Seriously, it's like four buckles spanning four inches. I would have liked to known that before buying it.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
This bra would be perfect if it didn't make my boobs look like cones. This bra is extremely comfortable and supportive but I can't wear it with anything because it make my breasts look horrible. This bra will never see the light of day.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I almost always order Bali bras because they are true to size.  I ordered 44DDD and it fits me perfectly and is very comfortable for maybe half a day.  After about 5 hours the underwire started to poke under my arms.  I much prefer not to wear any bra with an underwire because they are notoriously uncomfortable, but apparently there are none in my size.  The covering on the underwire is quite soft and cushiony but still the wires poke through into my under arms.  I am disappointed but maybe I am ordering the wrong size.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Wow...I should have listened to the other reviews. While it looks comfortable-- it isn't. The edges alone are scratchy and the torpedo look I could move past as I've had one other bra do that to me in the past, but after some time it worked itself out. I'd have ignored it completely if not for the scratchy feeling at the hem lines. There for it's being immediately returned.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I ordered these particular pantyhose, because I wanted to wear them with a form-fitting cocktail dress and I didn't want it to be obvious that I'm wearing pantyhose. And that was certainly true on the legs.  However, there is a very thick seam going from the crotch to the waste and it was very visible and there was nothing I could do to hide it. I ended up not wearing these pantyhose as result and will return the extra pair I ordered.  So, if you are going to wear them under a thick business suit skirt, then go for it. But if you want to wear them under a dress made out of a thin fabric, then these are not for you.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Not very happy... had this pair for 2 months.  Only wore a couple times each week before the sole fell off.  Had 2 other pairs that both lasted well over a year.  Very disappointed that this show fell apart after only 2 months.  And unfortunately the return window has passed.  Might have to think about another brand unless this can be fixed... just very disappointed since my other Stacy Adams pairs lasted so much longer.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue

Yes..I gotmy legs in them...but when they hit my thighs...it got tight. Let alone get them around my tummy. I'm not a small girl but I bought these with the expectation that they would fit.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"The fit was great, but evidently  they snagged on a fingernail the very first time I put them on.  Because they were sheer, I tried to be very careful in putting them on.  My nails are rounded on the edges so I was surprised when one of them caught on the hose. Not only did it leave a run, but it made a hole in them. Not even one wearing!  I would not recommend these if you're looking for something with durability. They are just too delicate to be practical.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

Look at that picture and all those seams and imagine them all scratching and irritating you, and the back hurting and itching as well, and save your money.  The nipple seams hurt even with nursing pads.I'm a size 36 J and found that the support was just OK, comparable to a cheap XL nursing bra from Walmart.  Really upset that I spent so much money on this poorly designed thing.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
entirely too small!  completely unable to wear these!,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
This bra provides ok support.  It's not the best and not the worst that I have found.  It is extremely itchy!  I even tried trimming the lace off but it's not the lace.  It is the fabric around the inside edge.  I am not sure what type of fabric it is but it definitely is not cotton!  When I took this bra off after wearing for a few hours my skin was red and very irritated around the edges of the bra.  The cup fit ok and inside seams didn't bother me.  It is one of the few that I have found in my size 38/40 H but there are others out there.  Unfortunately I was not able to return this because I prewashed and had to wear it because I didn't have another nursing bra.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"It lost its hold after a few hours. I am heavy busted and with milk it's worst, so this bra is not good for holding up anything that a nursing bra should. It seems as though the straps kept getting longer and longer as the minutes rolled by.  By the time I took it off it was a hula-hoop around the band and the length of suspenders at the strap, but did not support as well as suspenders. A picture is worth a thousand words, but this picture lied.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

So I wasted money.  Of the ones that did not have runs in them, they are okay but do not last for the amount of money you spend on them.  I will not buy them again.  It is so disappointing to now find good fitting pantyhose for the larger sizes.  I like the ones that have control top and reinforced toes.  I just have to keep looking",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I don't like writing 1-star reviews, but I really hate these pantyhose.  I'm 5'-10"" and curvy, which makes pantyhose a challenge.  These are awful.  They felt too short, and that extra crotch panel just gave the panty area extra seams to rub against me.  I will never buy these again.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I used the size chart when I ordered, but the hose seemed to run a little small. I wore them to a formal affair and when I went in the restroom I saw 2 wide runs going up the back of my leg.

"I have to say I am disappointed in this bra. My boyfriend bought this off of his Amazon prime account. He bought me a 36DDD. It fit me in the 36 part, but was too small in the bust. My DD bras from Playtex fit me better in the bust than this one does.Plus this bra is made very cheaply.

The side stays dig into my arm pits, the cup is sewn in such a way that it gives the appearance that the cup doesnt fill out, like its not a natural shape to your breast. My husband even commented that they look perky but not. It reminds me of the bras from 40 years ago.  The only positive is the straps don't slip and the band doesnt ride up on me.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"One star because the quality and the fabric seems a bit cheap. I don't anticipate this bra will last a long time, but that is ok for the price and the job it does. I don't wear the same bra everyday I trade off so that helps my bras to last longer. The straps have plenty of adjustment and do not dig into your under arms, that is my most hated thing about bras, I cannot stand tugging on it to keep it down. I don't have the problem here.UPDATE: After wearing this bra for 24 hours I am super disappointing. The material that the bra is made of is so cheap like mesh there is no fabric on this bra and it is so itchy scratchy. It also has this annoying seam across the breast that is very visible through a shirt. Don't even think about getting cold because it will show every outline of your nipples. I hate returning things so I will just donate it to a charity.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"What a disappointment!. Listed as 100% leather, well they do not meant real leather - all interior is fake leather. Listed as leather lining, no such thing, the lining is plastic feeling fabric.

Very disappointing.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"There is not much sense in having a wallet with 19 card slots when you can't use them all because everything is so tight you can hardly get the cards out. I couldn't even get the last 6 cards in the slots because it was so tight. The inside of the wallet does not look like any leather I've ever seen or felt. The outside feels like leather. The change purse does not snap closed very tight, causing it to open to easily. The sections that hold paper money are very nice.

"I researched leather checkbook wallets for about two weeks. I am a matchy-matchy type person and very picky; purchasing a separate leather checkbook holder that did not match the wallet grain and color exactly was not an option for me.Criteria are as follows (from most important to least):1. Red leather2. Matching checkbook holder3. Clear ID holder NOT in zippered compartment... snap flap/fold over OK4. 10+ credit card compartments that are NOT in a zippered compartment5. At least 1 main zippered compartment for cash and another zippered compartment (within main zippered compartment) for change6. Exterior pocket on the wallet... zipper preferred, no zipper OKThis wallet appeared to meet all of these criteria. It arrived within the estimated time frame, boxed, in perfect condition. Lovely red pebbled leather everywhere, all zippers slid nicely, and the snap fit securely in both holes. Everything seemed perfect until I tried to stuff my standard-sized Costco checks into the checkbook holder. The holder is at least 1/4"" too narrow; I had to chop off the sides of my checks to stuff them into the holder. Problem solved, right?NO. I could not close the darned checkbook holder. When I forced the top flap over my checkbook, I had to use a rubber band to hold it down, and the zillion digit routing/account/check number at the bottom was in complete view. It looks ridiculous, and I am beyond irritated every time I have to write a check for Girl Scout Cookies, school pictures, etc. The only reason I am still using it (rubber band and all) is because the leather matches the wallet, and I need another 100 hours to do research to find a replacement wallet/checkbook holder. Why, WHY do wallet manufacturers make gross, cheap plastic wallets anyway? They should know that anyone old fashioned enough to use a checkbook on a regular basis will want REAL LEATHER. I looked at wallets from $20 to $200, and I couldn't find another that met all of my criteria that was 100% leather.Enough of my ranting. I would not buy this product again, and I do not recommend it if you want a functional red checkbook holder to match your red wallet.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I purchased this wallet in Nov., 2014. I have bought only Buxton wallets over the years. Now 4 months later the catch for the change purse part broke off and I can't return it since it's been more than 30 days. I am so disappointed. I have come to expect good quality workmanship from Buxton and definitely didn't get it this time.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"The wallet looks and feels nice.  However, when I went to transfer my cards, etc. to it, I found that most of the card slots went all the way down, rather than being sewn closed at the correct height for  a credit card.  So I ended up not being able to use those slots at all, since I was afraid I'd never find the cards and/or be able to get them out again!  I don't know who reads these reviews, but if this is not the way the slots are supposed to be, I'd be happy to receive a replacement.  Debating about sending it back, but that's a hassle, especially if I don't know if I can get a better one.Also, my driver's license and/or my military ID will not fit into the slot with the clear plastic.  I've run into this problem with other wallets, but I could always manage to force them in, although getting them out again was a challenge.  On this one, I resorted to putting the ID in lengthwise, since I couldn't even fit it in horizontally.  They don't fit as securely this way.  I'm hesitant to cut them to fit in there, as I'm not sure if they'd fall apart or be invalidated if I did this.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"at least not any leather I've ever seen.  Even the wallet itself has two inserts titled ""Materials"" that explain that the exterior is (supposedly) leather and the interior is manmade materials.  Yet the website simply says ""Genuine Leather"" - as if for the whole wallet.  And there is a stamp embossed into the backside of the wallet also saying ""Genuine Leather"" - even though, by their own admission on the inserts, it only refers to the ""exterior.""  Yet even the exterior is not remotely like any real, new leather I have ever seen or sniffed.  This must be ""PU leather"" or some such.  It doesn't smell like leather (smells chemically actually) and it doesn't look like leather.  It looks like a ""processed meat"" version of leather from a wallet sausage factory.In addition, some of the commenters referred to it having a pen holder, which to me was an attribute.  Be advised that the pen holder is merely a slit in the interior ""manmade material"" to hook a pen over.  It's not the usual kind of pen holder in a wallet, which is a loop of leather to insert a pen through.Also, to confirm what others have reported, the checkbook divider is not removable despite what it says here - that's another misrepresentation about this item.Somehow this wallet is getting mostly rave reviews, which now completely baffle me.  Maybe the fake-leather look is more obvious in the Mahogany color but that's the only color that suited me of the choices given.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"This wallet would be fine if the credit card slots were wider. After reading other reviews about the same issue I thought I wouldn't care but it is incredibly inconvenient to pry my cards out every time I want to buy something so I promptly returned it.

I can also tell this in the fit and how much room my foot has. There's also the converse label. One is a much deeper red (the real one) and the other is a bright red (the fake). Also the shoes came with scuffs and there's some weird errors on the bottom of the sole that also doesn't look right. They are good fakes, and no one will know except you, but if you want real ones then go to a certified retailer. There's a reason these are so dirt cheap compared to the retail price. They're fake.

The box showed 6.5 in size. The shoes inside were 4.5. Fortunately they were the correct size for my 12 old daughter so they were not returned. were what was expected. I was hoping my daughter would have picked a higher quality shoe but that is the price of fashion i suppose.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I'm so bummed! I ordered these for an event where I needed to match other people in white Chucks.  I read the reviews and it looked like I should have ordered the men's size I wanted. Even the drop down menu listed sizes with (M) listed next to the size. I am a woman's 8 so I ordered a man's 6. Today I got them in the mail and they are woman's 6's. I have to return them and now I don't have shoes to match the dance team for our  performance. Did I say I'm bummed?,Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I ordered a pair of black converse MALE size 9 shoes with black shoelaces, the unisex model. What I received were size 9 WOMAN'S shoes... I had a feeling this would happen when I went to checkout and the name of the item went from converse unisex to converse woman's shoes. I have proof as I took a screen",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Package arrived on time and everything seemed to be just fine until I tried them on and realized they were too big. This was a men size and I probably didn't realized when ordered them, so my bad. However, it is also not very clear in the product description either if this would work as unisex, if is a size 7 for men and 9 for women, etc. So product description not really helpful.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"My review is not based on the converse shoe itself which we like but the service provided thru amazon. It is the 2nd time this has happened to me, I clearly got the women sizing but was sent mens sizing instead and they vary by 2 sizes!! So my daughter who is a 6.5 women should get a 4.5 mens size. But when choosing I clearly chose womens 6.5 so I don't know why the mix up.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"Until recently, i have been wearing and defending Chuck's for the past 25 years. BUT! The past three pair that i bought all blew out on me in less than a month! They either ripped at the heal. Popped open on the outside around the toes for when you are doing ollies. Cracked in the insole. Or all of the above! i hate writing this because i absolutely love what Chuck's USED to be! Converse used to be the great all American all purpose shoe that could be worn in any occasion. HELL! i wore mine to my high school prom!  But that is no longer the case. Instead, Converse's quality has steadily decreased over the years, while their prices have steadily increased over the years. How in the hell does that even make sense?! Now as for me and my family, we will no longer buy Chuck's until they raise their quality standards bcak to what they used to be. Because if they are just going to make crap shoes then why be loyal to the Chuck Taylor brand? Just buy some generic sneakers and paint them up yourselves. And maybe, just maybe Converse will start to listen and once again make that great all American, made in America shoe that we all once loved.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"#1- this is a bag, not shoes... so the review was quite interesting.My Problem with this bag, it was used for only a few hours and the zipper broke.

It is a wonderful bag... except the zipper doesn't work, making it basically worthless.Quite disappointed with this product.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

This is my fourth ameribag of this size. They seemed to change soe of the pockets and they added some kind of padding making it stiff. I don't care for any of the changes.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The size is all wrong. Ordering info was confusing. I Will not be able to use them my self. Bad luck!,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"This bag was not the one described by Amazon or the attached manufacturers card.  It has split pockets instead of one (with magnetic closures-credit cards don't react well with magnets, what were they thinking?). The attached manufacturers card also says there are two angled pockets and pen slots which do not exist.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"If you order this item, do NOT expect to get an HBB Classic bag, no matter what the description says. What you will get is the HBBevo model bag.Which is a fine bag, if that's what you want. It was not what I wanted, I wanted a Classic. The HBBevo has big slabs of foam stuffed into one side of the bag, to pad electronic devices, in case you want to carry them. Good idea. If you want to carry electronic devices.I don't. I'm disappointed in Ameribag, which apparently no longer makes the Classic in extra-small, and VERY disappointed in Amazon, who can't be bothered to update their page description. I thought I was getting what I wanted. I wasn't.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Shoes look good but unwearable because size 11 Men's fit like a size 13 for crying out loud! I may return these $40 disappointments or donate them to a big-footed homeless person. Haven't decided yet. So disappointed in these big floppy clown shoes. Edit: I returned the shoes. Easy and painless return policy.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I bought these shoes for my dad for Christmas - he likes the old school, original black high top converses.  The ones that arrived were black in color, but they are some type of tweed/pattern.  You can't tell from a distance, but they're absolutely not canvas.  I'm sad that I'm not giving my dad the shoes he had as a teenager, but they'll be nice shoes for him anyway.  I'm not returning and receiving these again when they took longer than everything else I ordered to get here.",Seller Issue,Product Issue

be aware of the size you are buying. the size chart provided it is not accurate..  dis not meet my expectations,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I thought these would be like the old style Converse from my younger days but these are very cheap with little to no support. they're like wearing nothing.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The shoe I ordered were supposed to be white and I received a totally different color. Had to pay to send them back Even though they acknowledged  it was an error on there part.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I think there are two versions of the shoe and interior. This one was poorly constructed and uncomfortable. I have seen the same shoe with a more contemporary interior and arch support. I would not reccomend this shoe for anyone. Check the same shoe out at the converse store and it is a better shoe.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I ordered these shoes to satisfy the Christmas wish of a client in a teenage shelter. The order arrived on my doorstep on the day before I had to get the gift bag to the shelter. There was no time for anything to go wrong. As I was putting all the items in the large gift bag, I decided to take a few minutes to admire the red Chuck Taylor shoes. Imagine my surprise when I found them to be a dull gray. I can only imagine the disappointment of the young woman at the shelter. I chose to shop on Amazon because of my strong positive experiences over the years. However, I'll never shop Amazon when time is so tight.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Trendi USA is the company that had the shoes for sale on Amazon. I received the shoes in a box that had a label stating the correct size of 6.5.  However, the shoes inside the box were 10.5.

"Good looking shoes, but...after just 1 month,the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends.  The shoe still looks perfect, but I had to use shoe goo to fix it.

"It arrived in horrible condition, the clock was all crushed and it was not in regular numbers like the picture has, it had roman numbers, I was very dissatisfied because I wanted the one with the regular numbers that is the main reason I ordered it, and it came all crushed and roman numbers, my grandson was highly upset and that made me very upset and sad.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Had no idea it was just a plastic shell with no back.  Guess I should have expected it for the price.  The issue is that it keeps flipping over to the empty back when you wear the fake watch.,Product Issue,Product Issue
This is a very thin stamped mold of a heart. You could probably rip the plastic if it caught on something and if the heart that step done or crushed in the kids backpack there would be no repairing it. The face of the clock is a sticker. This heart completes the tin man outfit.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"My clock didn't look like the one advertised, the numbers are scrolled.  But my stupidity in not paying closer attention, was that it's fake.  I of course thought it was going to be plastic, but also thought it was going to be able to be hung on the wall and watch it tick.  It looked really cute on the pictured advertised buy crappie when I got it. I can't send it back, it would cost me even more.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"This heart is very big even for an older child. I bought it for my baby knowing it would be large; however, this heart looks big on my husband. The chain is very flimsy and it uses a safety pin to secure it. Ended up making my own.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"This product was a HUGE disappointment.  I had read it was  made out of thin plastic, but I thought that it was a solid shape.  It is not.  The whole product is made out of extremely cheap plastic that tears if it is bent at all.  There is no back to the product.  It is  just the front of the clock with absolutely no plastic backing at all.  I bought it for my three year old's Halloween costume.  It will serve the purpose, but it looks like it is from a bubble gum machine and cost about 50 cents to make.  Meanwhile I paid almost $6 plus shipping.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
It is about as flimsy as a cheap paper plate.  not sure i will even use it for our oz production.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Very bad value.  Runs small and pretty sure they put a child's size hat in an adult costume package.  Very frustrated with this purchase,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I was very disappointed. It junk,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I was expecting at least a thicker plastic.$4 would have been expensive for this item. Definitely not worth it.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Same as with the Tinman's Heart, they just couldn't be bothered to slap on a piece of plastic for the back of this thing. Medal is hollow, white in the back so has to be covered or glued onto something to keep the empty white hollow cheapness of the thing from showing.  If you are going to sell something this cheaply made, it should be at the 99cent store, not for $8 to $10 to $12 on Amazon!  I mean really!  Shame!  I will never trust Rubies to sell me anything of quality.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I picked this one specifically because the ribbon in the pic was only red and white when I recieved it the ribbon was red white and blue I was very dissappointed,Product Issue,Product Issue

"Would not recommend buying these. Unless you like saunas on your feet while you are already seriously sweating on the line on a busy night. Great for non slip and they're basically slippers. Glorified crocks with nice birki soles. But seriously my feet have never sweated so much in my life. Unless your feet are always cold for some reason or you work in Antarctica, I wouldn't recommend these. Also you kind of have to shuffle to walk in them...bit strange. Gave em a chance for like 3 weeks and I can't hardly handle working another day in them.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I wish that Birkenstock offered this shoe and the professional in narrow sizes.  I have a medium width foot -- on the narrow side, but Birkenstock is the only shoe I need in a Narrow.

Hard and uncomfortable.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I purchased these shoes for work and being thatI am a server on a cruise line which means I'm walking back and fourth to the kitchen  these shoes were not easy to walk in  When I tried them on at home. So I had to return them. If your buying them for measure they may work out for you...,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
" Unfortunately, the size charts did not match up and the shoes were far too loose for me to walk in, let alone at a quick pace or up and down stairs. I felt that they were going to fall off and that I could even trip or fall. I am a diminutive lady, 5'2"" and only 92 lbs. agile but, I don't want to fall and get hurt. There are enough hazards in the environment of my duties that I cannot control. I need shoes that fit snugly and comfortable. I was quite disappointed with this pair of shoes and returned them forthwith. Dansko was the brand I replaced them with, at a higher price, and those shoes are what I needed for comfort as well as support.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I ordered these for my fiance who is a chef and works on his feet all day. He has an old pair and I figured these were the same because they are the same brand. Boy was I wrong. The ""cork"" footbed that it claims supports your arch is solid as a rock and not practical for any type of use. He couldn't imagine how he would even walk in them. In the picture they look different once you try them on. Most of your heel stikcs out and there isn't a lot of coverage. On the description it says these are great for gardening. There is no way you could wear these in the garden without getting your foot dirty or without your foot sliding out. I don't know if these are a new version of the typical Birkenstock or what. The information included in the package is not user friendly and in another language. Definitely not satisfied with these, returning them today.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I love Birki's!!! Dont let my rating fool you, i have worn Birkenstock shoes for about 20 years and this is the first pair of kitchen shoes i have bought and All i have to say is that they don't truly soften up much.

"This hat is not satin as advertised. The material is see-through like gauze. Even the tag says ""fabric witch hat"" rather than ""satin witch hat.""

Horrible product and the seller will not do returns. Product will not attach to Suunto core watch as advertised.,Product Issue,Product Issue
They way the strap goes on leaves a piece of fabric that just tucks under the Velcro and over your wrist.

I never received it. It was lost in mail. So few bigger sizes so the company wasn't able to replace it. Out of all the things I've ordered this was the only one that didn't come.

"So, after hearing my daughter rave about this exercise bra I decided to buy one. I had been looking for something that would keep me motionless up top as I run and jump rope. I might add that I've never spent what amounts to the annual salary of a worker in an underdeveloped nation for one exercise bra. It's quite ridiculous especially when considering what I'm about to say...Oh, don't get me wrong. It looks quite formidable--just like the pics, but au contraire. I was excited as I put her on for a test drive this morning. It looked pretty inconspicuous under my clothes-- a good sign I told myself. I walked a couple laps around the track then picked up my jump rope and proceeded to jump & JIGGGLLLLEE-- yes ladies-- jiggle. I'm reeeeaally disappointed because I'm rather shy and needed something that would allow me to jump rope sort of unnoticed while out in public. It looks like it'd probably serve well as a bust minimizer, but it's not my idea of a truly supportive exercise bra.And, it's certainly not worth the $64 I paid.To be even more candid, I get more support from my 12+ year old ""champion"" exercise bra!

"I bought this bra for $79. I do think it gives decent bounce control (42D) but the band is too tight if the cup size is correct and is giving appropriate bounce control. In addition, the straps are far to short for anyone that is taller or has a long torso causing the bra to either slide up or cut into the shoulder. I actually took a pair of scissors to mine lengthening the band by two inches, adding a 2-3 inch strap extension with extra soft padding on top of the shoulder. The final sewing adjustment was to trim the top 3 hooks and create a bra that is not similar to wearing a straight jacket. Waste of a lot of cash.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

the costume looks adorable but its not. its made so cheaply! the sleeves are mesh and so uncomfortable. the bottom of the sleeve had elastic i guess so it can look poofy but it was so tight on her arms it made a mark. i had to return it. the skirt part had no body to it. it had no tafeta. i don't recommend it. i ended up buying one drectly from disney store and that one was soooooooooo adorable!!,Seller Issue,Seller Issue

"I didn't think I carried that much into work each day, but I had trouble putting more than a few small items and pieces of paperwork into this briefcase. It does not seal securely and I found that things (anything carried in the main pocket), would fall out without warning during normal use. Not fun to lose a cell phone or sunglasses! It's probably okay if you really only carry a few things back and forth, or have a set of screwdrivers and wrenches to carry around to jobsites, but most of the little pockets are so constrained that it was not useful for general use by me.It is rugged and it weared well for a couple of months, but I had to switch to something bigger and more secure in holding onto its contents. If the main flap went all the way to the bottom it would probably be much more secure -- the top flap barely overlaps the main pocket. Also, the central clasp makes the bag tend to fold in half around it. As a result you end up with a curved bag that looks funny and tends to warp pads of paper, instead of a straight bag more like a briefcase or messenger bag that keeps its contents safe.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

size said 3-4t and it was actually more like 2t,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
My son is 3 1/2.  petite for his age.  The ad does not say this is an inflatable piece.  He hasn't popped it (yet).  He's used it twice to accent his buzz lightyear costume.  The pack is an appropriate size for him.  There are very thin elastic straps with short Velcro strips to wear it like a back pack.  the problem is to actually wear it the jetpack can't be inflated complete.  The Velcro straps are too small to hold.  I am sure the design was meant to be small to hide the straps however this makes them difficult to stay shut & impossible for my son to put it on himself.  He's an independent kiddo so this causes him some frustration.  He's disappointed I can't inflate it completely for him to wear it.  He calls it broken because the wings sag. There's no separate blow in for the top of the wings or the ends of the wings making it difficult to evenly inflate.  Overall... it's a cute accessory but not worth the buy.  I'll probably try safety pinning to his costume for Halloween but wish I hadn't purchased it for him.  He wouldn't miss it if I had passed it up.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue

The wings are just blown up like a pool toy. I thought they were going to be made of pillow type material. They look great with the costume but I am not sure how long they are going to last without getting a hole in them. It is not worth the $9.00 extra on top of the price of the costume itself.

"I purchased this outfit for my one year daughter for Halloween. I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid, so overall I would say that I got what I expected. The size stated on the outfit was 12-18 months. My daughter is on the small side and this was not big on her at all. At the time she wore it she was 13 months and wearing 9 month clothing.  The quality of the material is pretty low and tore easily during the only time she wore it. In addition, there is a medallion in the center of the dress by the neckline. The medallion is not secured very well and was constantly flopping around and getting in the way. Lastly, the ears that come with the costume are very flimsy and one ear constantly flops over. Overall, if you are looking for an inexpensive Minnie Mouse costume and don't play on using it too much, this may do the job. However, if you are looking for a costume that your child can wear multiple times, this may not work.Cons:1) The costume is much smaller than the stated 12 to 18 month size. It fit my daughter who was wearing 9 month size clothes at the time.2) The material is not great and the material around the shoulder/sleeve tore slightly during first wear.3) The medallion in the center is not secured well and gets in the way.4) The ears are not well made and one ear was folded over.5) The buttons on the back of the dress don't secure it very well.Pros:1) The price is low, but perhaps still a little too high for what you get.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue

The costume states that it's a child size 4-6 (small) when in reality it's 4T-6T. Those are two COMPLETELY different sizes. My son looks like pee wee herman in this costume. I called the company and the only way they will refund my money for the full amount is to exchange it for a different product on their website. Otherwise you only get back half of what you paid for.

"Not at all like the picture, and it's falling apart",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
It fell apart immediately. My daughter was not able to use it.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Absolutely not as pictured. It's a sad excuse for a broom - even a witches broom.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The package came in a very large box but ended up being way too short and very spare. Looks nothing like the product photo.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
This product is very flimsy and definitly not worth the price. It was falling apart in the box when it arrived even though it was packaged correctly.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
eh.  Fell apart coming out of the box.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
This broom that I ordered is a very skimpy version of the picture. I could have made one better.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
It will work... but it's a terrible quality.. there's barely even any straw on the one I received,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Does not look like the photo.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The bristles constantly fall out and is cheaply made. You don't even want to move the thing at all because so many of the bristles will just fall out.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"It was scraggly, and barely had enough branches to qualify as a broom. The pictures are inaccurate, and really qualify as a false depiction of what you'll get if you order this.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Much too small.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
This is literally a piece of bamboo with twigs loosely tied to it. It looks nothing like the picture and can hardly pass as a broom.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Not that much to this product. Very small.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
One time use only. Fell apart in an hour of 8 years old kid playd with it,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
So seriously... what the heck? Wasn't worth the measly dollars spent nor the single star given just to write this. I couldve just went to the woods and tied something better together (likely will now too). DO NOT Buy This!!!!,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"The crappy costume, It had about 8 pieces of whatever that straw stuff they use is and most of those fell out.  Hat with the holes in it right out of the package and this really crappy broom were hugely disappointing.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I bought this for my 5 year old, to go with her Halloween costume. She used it for less than an hour before completely falling apart. Ended up in the trash before she even got to trick or treat.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Very disappointing to small and cheap appearance. Would. It recommend. Certainly not worth the money.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Don't not purchase this broom!!!! The broom is of cheap quality and there are only a few bristles on the broom. The actual broom does not look like the picture.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"This is much smaller than expected. Also, the broom portion is very thin and arrived broken. We returned it as soon as it arrived.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"It is a joke calling it 'Deluxe'. Ridiculous poor quality! Everything fallen apart soon I have received it. Btw, I found it sells only 4.99 at Party City. Crossed listed price 39.99 is totally misleading! A piece of junk!",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Flimsy,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
I thought that it would be full of bristles like the picture shows. It looks like something I could make at home to be honest.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I do not recommend spending $40 for this when the mask that comes with the costume has better paint, and overall looks better.",Seller Issue,Product Issue
Cheaply made. Fell apart within days.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
It was falling apart when I received it--most of the bristles were broken off. It was basically just a stick. Very poorly made.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"TERRIBLE!!! The helmet is misshaped. The plastic for the eyes press into your brow.  Looks very cheap. The Company wouldn't let me return the product, but exchange instead.  Exchange it for what? A different low quality product? No thanks",Seller Issue,Product Issue
"Too short, too skimpy... Why does this say adult? It was so pitiful looking it's the Halloween version of Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Very poor quality. The mask looks like its deformed. The lever on the side that folds down was broken upon opening. I wouldnt waste your money. I won't buy from this company again.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Not happy at all the box was opened the mask had been squished since it's made out of material that can be bent it seemed as if the post office stacked heavier boxes ontop of the box the helmet came in there was no protection for it inside so obviously the mask was really deformed in the front view. Plus the colors are WAY off.As soon as a submitted my review I was still looking at the mask and noticed it was broken at the bottom park oh well so I added that picture too,Product Issue,Product Issue
Only about 10% of the bristles as shown.  Poorly represented.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Such an aweful product. They have ignored my calls and requests for a return.  Do not buy anything from CostumeHub. They do not care about their customers like they falsely claim they do.This thing arrived in a busted up box that looked like it had been stepped on.  I opened it to find a warped  and cheaply made helmet with super glue smeared over the visor.  This thing was awful. It isn't even fit for wearing since it was so bent out of shape and the bottom edges were razor sharp.  Such a bad buy.CostumeHub has no interest in conducting good business.  Save your money.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"When The box arrived, there were multiple holes in the box, and inside was no padding at all. The antena would not stay up, no padding inside helmet, and the front plastic was poorly attached (the edge of it was visible from a distance). Otherwise the mask doesn't look too bad, and could be a decent base if you wanted to modify. I purchased 2 of them at $20 each, and paid almost $40 for shipping. It would have been worth the money, if it weren't double in shipping.",Product Issue,Product Issue
Fell apart several times before the first use. The straw is held on to the stick with only twine and the twine is not sufficiently tight or properly strung to stay attached to the handle.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"well we never even got it out of the package and it fell apart.  It now is just put away on a shelf becuase I do not know what to do with the thing, you move it or touch it and twigs just fall off.  Very messy.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I got this broom for a film project. So excited when it came in the huge box! I opened it and found a 20"" broom at the very bottom. ""Adult"" witch broom is more so a ""toddler"" witch broom. I ha to replace the bamboo stick with a big bamboo stick, which then made the bristles at the end not proportionate.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Fell apart on day 2 of ownership. The string holding the ""straw broom"" together fell off the broomstick causing all of the straw to be deposited on to my living room floor. Worthless piece of garbage, do NOT wast your time or money on this item.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I purchased this broomstick for my daughter for her Halloween costume of the Wicked Witch of the West.  When we opened the box, the only thing intact was the stick, the bristles on the broom were not attached to the stick at all.  I tried to remake the broom stick, but even with all of the bristles that were in the box, it is a very poor broomstick.  This is going right in the garbage can and I will be purchasing a better one!!!",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
This broom definitely wasn't worth it.  There is barely anything to it.  It is small with very few bristles. I bought it as a prop for a witch costume.  It definitely won't work for that.  It barely works as a Halloween decorative piece.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"It is about 3 feet tall, so if you are very short, it might work, but I was a broomless witch last Halloween because it stayed in the closet.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Total waste of money! I spent almost as much for this tiny little broom, as I did for the costume!! Boo! Major disappointment!",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"This broom was much, much more sparce in the bristle department than the picture would lead one to believe. All the bristles fell off when the bit of twine holding them on came unglued. My kid wasn't trying to sweep or use it as a broom, just ""fly"" it about the house. Not worth it for a toy that fell apart after three days.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Opening thethe package, I noticed that the broom is extremely short not nearly the 41"" that was advertised. The bristles were very bare and when I took it out of the box the handle fell off of the bristles! The handle will not go back on because of how the bristles were bound at the top and the seller does not accept returns! Thank goodness this wasn't too expensive, but the quality and durability won't even last 5 minutes, let alone a Halloween night, whether you are an adult or a child. I am very disappointed with this product. I gave this product one star because a half star or no star was not an option! I will not be shopping with this seller again!!!",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Broom fell apart before Hallowen had to put back together. Fell apart again didn't last long would not recommend. Bad construction.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The wig is garbage. You can see seams and it looks like some one intentionally cut the top into spikes which makes it worse! If I was going as welfare kiss it would be great! I bought this for the wig!,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The size for the costume according to the size chart was 2 sizes to small so we couldn't go trick or treating kids was devastated,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Fair quality. It would serve it's purpose for one night of trick or treating. However, I was very disappointed in the fit. I ordered size 4-6. My son wears 4t and some 5t and it was tight and too short. It should've fit more comfortably. Thinking about returning as we have not used it yet.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"This is VERY small. My son is barely in a 4t and can barely fit into this costume. My son, without clothes underneath is in floods.As expected, it is very cheaply put together as well.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"First and foremost, this piece of crap is not satin.  It's a cheap poly/nylon mesh that's entirely see-through, and it is nowhere near the size indicated in the photos.  One of the key pieces -- a witch's hat -- would have been missing.It's a child-size piece of costuming, and it was absolutely not worth what I paid for it, even with my Prime discounts.  I could have gotten a better piece at the local s***ty Halloween seasonal stores, probably for half the price.  Do not buy -- it's not even worth the return shipping on it, and it'll probably get given out at my Halloween event to a kid as a cheap prize.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"I feel like that one star I clicked is as misleading as the pictures used to market this piece of garbage. It comes in a box twice the size so you believe, WOW, this is IT. When you open it, it looks like a feather duster that survived a nuclear attack. The actual broom part is so thin and see through it's like a man with a comb over trying to pretend his hair isn't gone. IF a witch were to ride on this 3 foot long stick, she would die. Because the broom hairs are not abundant enough to support her weight under the pressure of the air. I wasted my time in ordering it, opening it but I did not waste my time writing this review. Because if you, reading this review, are saved from the utter disappointment of buying this heap of junk on a stick, then my time has been spent wisely. Unless you are a masochist- do not buy this.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
The head piece would fit an infant(bought it for my 2 year old).  I bought a size 4-6....  and could even get it up. Order at least one size bigger tha. You think you need.,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Disappointed. This is a one-piece outfit - jacket does not detach. The major problem is that the only opening is the neck opening, meaning that somehow you have to get a toddler into a long-sleeved, long-pants non-stretchy one-piece outfit using only the neck opening. The only way I can use it for my grandson is to split the back several inches and sew in velcro closings. It will ruin the appearance of the costume, but will at least make it usable. The bow tie is not sequins as described, just cheap polyester. The hat is useless. It is tiny - would fit an infant - and the ears are very small - not like the picture at all. I'm on the search for an appropriate Mickey hat/headband to use instead. Sorry I spent the money on this.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Thus is more a 4T, will not fit 5/6 it states L/G 4-6 but untrue. Also the bow is not sequence, it's just red. I would recommend hand washing and line dry, otherwise it gets very linty and the coat tails curl under. My son just turned 5, I bought this 8 months ago, my son was 42"" tall in a size 4-5T and he out grew this months ago.. Definitely a Toddler costume.",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
Did NOT fit the average size of a 3t-4t. Fitting was more for a 2t,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
"Not so much:( I ordered a size up and it was still too small. Plus, I know costumes are typically not the same quality as regular clothing, but this looked soooo ceap! Would not recommend",Seller Issue,Seller Issue
This costume was a huge let-down. It is way too small and cheaply made. I was left trying to figure out a way my son could wear it without looking like he grew 6 inches over night. His Disney costume from last year is same size (4-6) as this one and fits perfectly...this costume looks like it was made for a toddler. Would not buy again,Seller Issue,Seller Issue
