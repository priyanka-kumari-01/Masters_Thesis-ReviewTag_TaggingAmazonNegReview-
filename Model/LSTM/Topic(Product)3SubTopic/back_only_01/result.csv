"I've been looking for a warm, cozy pair of slippers with an indoor/outdoor type outsole.  My issue with this pair of slippers is poor fit and disappointing inner and outer soles.I wear a 9.5 B in woman's sizing. If I wore a 10.5 shoe, perhaps the fit would be better, but it doesn't work for a size 9.5. They are too loose, especially the part that wraps around my heel. It is not snug enough to keep the slippers on my feet while walking: my heels slip up and down and I have to work at trying to keep the slippers from coming off by spreading out my toes. This makes  walking awkward and unpleasant. I flop around in these....more like wearing a slider than a moc.I also did not like the flatness of the inner sole which contributes to the loose feel of the slippers--no shaped liner for some arch support. And I was mislead by the product description claim that these slippers are ""great for taking Scruffy the dog out for his morning gaunt"" [sic]. I expected a more substantial outer sole. Within one minute of trying them out I realized they'd have to go back.I finally found what I wanted! For those that want a more substantial and perfect fit winter slipper, check out Haflinger boiled-wool slippers. This is what I bought and really like: Haflinger Women's ""AT Storm"" flat in size 41 (woman's sizing!). It has an adjustable velcro strap to provide a snug fit, latex-molded insole, and waterproof rubber outsoles.

However, this proved not to be true as I was absolutely freezing for my entire trip. Even when the weather didn't reach below 60 and I had layers on top, I would still be absolutely miserable from being so cold. What's worse is that after wearing them once, they stretched out so much to the point where they wouldn't even stay up and I was constantly having to pull them up, which was especially tricky as I was carrying a 50lb pack all day long.

"If you're wondering whether or not you want to be a death eater for Halloween, read this breakdown and you can decide for yourself if its for you!First things first, the shipping. It was 2 day shipping for me, and I actually ended up getting it the next day, chalk one up for UPS!Second, the packaging. Now this isn't the most durable costume in the world, but there was plenty of airbags and everythingseemed to be well placed, the ONLY thing I could find wrong with the way it was packaged was that there was a SLIGHT dent in the mask, but since its really thin i kind of expected it to be flattened, which it was not, Way to go guys.Third, the costume itself. You get what is says really, a hooded robe with a separate, (but attachable via included strings) hood. Personally I like that its not sewed on there so I have the option, but that's up to you. The holes in the arms ARE intentional, they're put there so that you can wear the sleeves like a glove (just like the picture shows). The only odd thing I saw was that the collar appeared to face the direction in which wearing it right would leave the opening by the legs on my backside,though I just opened it so maybe i put it on backwards or something. I might just make a cut along the fabric so there's an opening on both sides, it just seems cooler and more comfortable to me. The mask is kind of cheap, but its not going to easily rip as long as you're gentle with it. Obviously you're going to need a wand, but that's sold separately (just in case you didn't read the product description).And to top it off, it even came in a resealable bag with an attached coat hanger, so when you're done with it you can hang it up for next year, or for someone else to use! Have fun and go kill some muggles!EDIT(11/1/11)I must have been handling this costume way too carefully when I took it out of the box. While all of what I said above is still true, the costume was made without any concern to quality. While walking, this thing was constantly ripping, and by the end of the night was no longer usable. Would I still recommend it? Sure, if you have someone willing to sew it for you like I did, but not for the price its asking. Lower it by about 20 bucks, and THEN you're asking a fair price for the amount of work you put into the material and construction (it honestly felt like they used the cheapest quality, thinnest fabric they could find) that you put into this thing. I'm not surprised by this turn of events, but I do feel kind of cheated.",Quality Issue,Product Description Issue

"After years of searching for the ""perfect jeans,"" I finally discovered Lucky Brand, and have worn them exclusively for many years. In the past, I've always bought directly from the store. When ordering online, I decided to conduct an experiment (given the inconsistency in ratings): I ordered one pair from Amazon's site, and another directly from the manufacturer.  The two are absolutely identical in title: 181 Relaxed Straight, same waist & inseam, and all the logos & insignias on the product match completely.  To be honest, they look exactly the same.However, these two jeans could not be more different. The denim used in the ""official"" pair is soft, cozy, velvety, maybe even luscious. In contrast, the denim used in the pair from Amazon is rough, stiff, scratchy, and generally uncomfortable.  I wanted to discredit the latter as a cheap knock-off, but as I wrote, it unequivocally bears the seal of the Lucky Brand company.After looking closely, I was finally able to find a subtle deviation in the ""style"" code hidden underneath the tags.

"BEWARE  DON'T BUY A CASIO - IF AN ALARM IS A IMPORTANT FEATURE  (any ""alarm"" watch, in particular a Casio Men's ""W201-1AV Alarm Chronograph"" - the exact name on Amazon's site for the watch I purchased).  Note the name ""Alarm Chronogragh"":  it could not be a more specific designation associated with purpose and function.WHY:  Casio Men's w201-1AV Alarm Chronograph's alarm is allegedly inaudible due to its frequency for certain people according to Casio.  And they expressly stated their alarms all have the same frequency proprietarily between 1- 6000 hertz.  I'm guessing that is the range of possible human hearing.  Why they would not divulge that specific frequency is a mystery - as any audiometer or frequency measuring device could detect a frequency so there is no ""trade secret"" type reason for preventing such a disclosure.I had initially thought I had set the alarm incorrectly - I may have done it wrong - so asked my neighbor who is a watch collector to set and test the alarm, and no alarm.  His sister did it too - no audible alarm.I then called Casio well before the warranty expired (I'd worn the watch for less than 24 hours total) - the Casio rep on the phone had me do an alarm test set and I held the watch 1"" from the receiver - she heard no sound and once again I did not.  When she could not hear it she authorized repairs.  At my expense I sent the watch to ""TIME MACHINE"", Casio's authorized repair center.  TIME MACHINE sent the watch back with a invoice which is too faint to be reproducible which stated nothing was wrong with the alarm or watch.  Be that as it may, when I sent this watch to Casio's repair service ""TIME MACHINE"" a total of four people could not hear the alarm prior to sending it.But TIME MACHINE's rep (""Abel"") called before sending the watch back and left a voice message:  that ""certain people"" can't hear the alarm frequency.  Neither myself or my neighbors have hearing problems - none of us wear a hearing aid.I called both Casio and the TIME MACHINE and complained that such a situation was ludicrous.  I was told to send the watch back to the TIME MACHINE and they would act as a liaison and assist me in getting a replacement.  Sent the watch back on my dime again.I have never had a problem with an alarm watch before.  I paid about half the value in postage. Casio has refused to replace the watch -  Casio is knowingly selling ""alarm"" watches - advertising that particular feature - to people who have no hearing known hearing problems but for the ""proprietary"" and un-disclosable frequency Casio uses for its alarms.  Selling them to people who will not be able to hear the alarm with no warning or disclaimer associated with the advertising.A lot of hassle for a $12 watch.  And they're sending back the same unit that can not be heard.  A not so quality response from what I thought was a quality company.What a sham!!  Shame on Casio.  BEWARE10.24.14  UPDATE (on 10.20.14 review above):TIME MACHINE sent watch back ""Signature Requested"" - strange thing for a $12 watch with taping stating a warning to inspect contents if seal is broken.  That is rare for a $12 watch.  I happen to be a former attorney who got sanctions against an alleged FBI agent.  I have lived an electronic ""Alice in Wonderland"" electronic life ever since.  I could be regarded as a whistle blower.NOTE Casio's blurb under their product description for this watch at Amazon:""Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.""Ask yourself if watches can be radio controlled why not the alarm function?  And if the FBI / NSA is or can be monitoring non internet connected stand alone on-line computers remotely via electromagnetic radiation (eg. radio waves) why not ""watches"" and their alarm functions.  And if Microsoft Google and major telecommunications companies reluctantly and on a delayed basis have admitted being in the bed of intrusive technology with the FBI / NSA, why not Casio either wittingly or unwittinglyThe real issue in this review is that ""certain people"" cannot hear a Casio alarm with a specified proprietary frequency that is supposedly in the human hearing frequency range but Casio refuses to disclose that frequency presumably (the only apparent logical assumption) on some type of trade secret proprietary basis.  Yet that is something that could be easily and precisely detected by fairly inexpensive instruments.  Something does not add up.  Perhaps 2 + 2 is really 5 (referencing Orwell's  ""1984"")This comment is appropriate to the Amazon review because Casio's reps said that ""others"" have problems hearing their unidentified watch alarm frequency (which they stated was the same for, and common to, all their alarm watches) - not just the folks I cited above directly involved with me who have no apparent or known hearing defects.What a sham!!  Shame on Casio.  BEWARE",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue

"20 months or so ago, I purchased a pair of Bistro directly from the Crocs website and was supremely happy with my choice. At the time, I followed other reviewers' advice to purchase the clogs 1 size smaller at 6 Women's/4 Men's than my usual size of 7 W/5 M. As mentioned, I could not be happier with my Crocs which I still currently work in despite their falling apart soles. Compared to working in a busy kitchen environment with any other shoes (I work a lot!), my experience with my old Bistro clogs (made in China) was blissful. I also learned from other buyers that Crocs made in China are somewhat roomier than the ones made in Mexico. This turned out to be an important distinction. Fast forward to this recent purchase from ShoeBuy (the vendor) via Amazon, these Crocs were made in Mexico (a fact not mentioned or the sizing difference explained in the product description). I cannot say anything about their wear outside of the sizing as these Crocs are too small for me to even put on. When I was making the purchase, I actually tried to order in my correct size (7 W/5 M) but was advised by Amazon that based on my size and previous purchases to go for size 6 W/4 M. For the last week, I have been trying unsuccessfully to return these too-small clogs to ShoeBuy (minus restocking fee) in order to repurchase Bistro in a larger size but that is another story.The takeaway moral of this tale is to(a) make sure you know the manufacturing source and provenance of the clogs (made in Mexico or China); and,(b) avoid purchasing from ShoeBuy even if their prices may be slightly lower than other vendors. I requested a refund (minus restocking fee) and was promised a return shipping label within an hour twice, once via email and the last time over the phone with their sales rep. Still no return shipping label after a week (I do know all about checking spam and other email folders).Avoid ShoeBuy, avoid, avoid! (but that is another story unrelated to the wear and sizing of Bistro Crocs (which I adore).",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue

"Boots arrived exactly on time, as predicted. The product appeared top shelf, although these things are STIFF. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity, yet, to feel them on my feet. I spent a great deal of time reading reviews for this product and, noting the comment in the product description--that many purchasers go down a 1/2 size--I ordered the 8.5 rather than the 9. A 9 is my size in everything...other boots, running shoes, etc. I have a completely normal size 9 foot. I could not fit my foot into the 8.5 in this boot. My advice would be to order your normal size, and disregard the tales of how big these run. BTW, I'd disregard the suggestions that you go to a store and try them on ""first,"" before ordering from Amazon. That is a sin. Amazon has a generous and easy return policy. Don't abuse your local merchants.",Design Issue,Product Description Issue
"I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon.  The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer.  They were durable and fit well.  They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing (I estimate around 40-50 washes).  So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work.  I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own.  But I wanted the less 'slim' fit of the 505s for work, also wanted the regular and not low rise waist.  So I ordered the same exact size and style:Bad idea!The 505s I got came with a tag saying 'sits below waist', which is NOT what they used to say.  Before, the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s.  Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon, I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair.  Trying the new pair on, I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my 'man parts' being crushed in agonizing ways.  No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans, and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area.  The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s, but the seat was the main difference.  No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505.And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s (in the same color as the new 505s I purchased) I noticed something interesting.  The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s.  It wasn't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing.  The 515s never felt that tough, and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description (no mention of low rise waist) and inferior quality.  I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store.  The previous 505s were also great (Fred Meyer of all places - though they don't have the 505s anymore... booo).  So I'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them.  I'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood.  And the better quality denim means they'll last longer anyway.  So here are my comparisons:Levi's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described, and that the quality appears to vary from order to order.  I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews.  I love Levi's jeans, and I will continue to buy them, but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing.  And remember, if you buy from Amazon, they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items.",Design Issue,Product Description Issue
"I have another pair of 14H Levi's that are ""loose straight"" fit and they fit perfectly. However, I wanted to try the ""bootcut"" style for a more trim look. According to the product description I assumed it would fit similarly, but that was not the case. When I put them on, they were SO much tighter than the ""loose straight"" fit, almost looking like skinny jeans. Upon reading the tag, it was ""regular bootcut,"" as opposed to the ""loose"" fit that was advertised. I am disappointed with my purchase. I was going to give it 1 star, but because of Amazon's excellent return policy, it warranted an extra sympathy star.",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue
"This Hanes has FreshIQ, which I don't want and it was not in the product description. I have no idea what freshIQ is. Is fresh IQ a toxic chemical? I don't need freshIQ and I definitely don't want freshIQ and more complicated clothes. I got 3 stripes and they are only 50% cotton. I ordered 6 and got a 7 pack. I refuse to wear these until I find out what freshIQ is, so I can't say for sure on comfort. My old hanes have an elastic waistband that's not totally covered and it chafes when taking off and it's not very comfortable, but I'm desperate, which is why I decided to try hanes again. The underwear market is terrible, so consider these despite my negative review. Fruit of the loom also fails to completely cover the waistband elastic and also the leg elastics. Old Hanes does cover the leg elastics, but it's very thin in that area. I liked reebok (double layer in front), but the front center vertical seam was irritating a sensitive area, but I still think still reebok might work for some people who are not as sensitive as I am and want 2 layers in the front area, although it took 1 year for reebok to bother me. Jockey elance men's are too small, too tight, and too thin (1 ultra thin layer), but have fully covered elastics, although a bit thin and cheap. Jockey right side seam is thick and irritating. Sadly, all brands have problems. Good luck. Reebok has the best waistband and leg openings even though they have unnecessary front center seams.",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue

Seriously, when the UPS guy pulled in front of the house my hubby ran outside like a school girl. The packaging opening scene that followed was something straight out of Christmas morning with small children. And then came the complaints. The hat is not a Condor hat, really, he made me go look at the condor site, and he is right it is not a Condor hat. The velcro thingies for patches are not the sizes listed in the product description on amazon. Apparently the camo is not genuine multicam, he keeps ranting there's pink in there, I don't know what this means, I just know the camo is not right. He dragged out his camelbac to illustrate the differences, as though I hadn't already gotten the point. Real condor hats are 100 percent cotton this thing isn't, but its product description says it isnt, so I don't know. The hat does seem rather cheaply made.

"I was really excited to try this out because I'm a super multi-tasker.  I first ordered the L/XL/XXL because my ""girls"" are totally huge compared to their previous size and I couldn't find a size chart on the amazon product description. I used to be a 36 C and they are really big now, so I was really frustrated when I had to return it for the xs/s/m size (+1 star for ease of return.)So then my itty bitty bra comes.  It's got this velcro panel for expansion, which is cool.  Here's where the flaw lies.  In the pursuit of building a ""1-size-fits 50% of women"" bra, it fits horribly.  It is just like a giant panel of material without any contouring.  If I don't want my boobs to be soar at the end of the day, I have to zip it up so tight that the compression of the unit holds me in place, which causes a LOT of rubbing and I was completely raw by day 2.  If you don't zip it up that tight, your boobs just drop, completely unsupported because the fabric goes straight down after the ""cup"" and there is literally no support under your breast.  I tried the straps, didn't help.  I'm right in the middle of the road as the sizing on this particular bra, so it's not a ""this size just doesn't fit you issue.  I can't imagine that this would support anyone unless they were completely flat chested!  I'm so upset...I'd return it if I could.

But now, in 2011, as I'm looking at them wondering if I should take the time to cut the multitude of strings that are coming from each strap or just throw them out, it's a major issue.Because faux leather doesn't wear nearly as well as real leather, I wouldn't have purchased these shoes had I not been misled by the product description.

"Updated below.I have been wearing Justin 3133s almost daily for over 30 years.  First to school and on the ranch as a work boot, and then as a uniform boot.  When I first buy them, I write the date in them, and then I would write the date in them every time I had a new sole put on them.  Well that was back when they were worth having repaired.  Today they're like most everything else.  The quality is out the window and you throw them away.  The proof is that I still have 3133 Ropers that are dated from high school in the 80s.  Ever since they moved the operation to Mexico, the stitching blows out LONG before the soles wear through, and then if you try to get them repaired the leather won't hold, plus they have to get deeper bite which makes them fit tighter than before.  In Justin's ultimate wisdom they now have what they CALL a Roper that is American made, but it's not the 3133.  It's a different leather that doesn't shine up well for a uniform boot, they fit differently so you'll likely wear a different size, and it has a contrasting color stitching around the top.  The two stars is for Justin's commitment to quality.  If you need a plain black cowboy boot that is pretty comfortable just buy them, put a little liquid nails on them when they start blowing apart, and then toss them and go buy another pair.Hey Justin:  How about bringing the original 3133 back to America to be made, and send that two bit imitation Roper down there?Update:  I changed my rating from two stars to one star as they have gotten even worse.  I really planned to do my first ever video review, but it seems I never have the time.As I stated above, I write the date in my boots the first time I wear them.  I didn't start wearing these until the end of March 2014, and these were just going to be a pair of non-work boots that I just kept nice and wore to the office.  Additionally, that means that I don't wear these everyday.  Then a few weeks ago at the end of December 2014, I was walking in on a rainy day and notice my foot was wet.  I looked down and the stitching had already blown out on the inside of one of the boots.  Then a week or so later I noticed it had blown out on the other boot as well.It's also important to note that these boots have never even needed to be polished!  They've been worn occasionally to the office, for 9 months, and have been so lightly worn that they're not even scuffed.  The soles still have plenty of leather on them, yet the stitching has blown out.After almost 4 decades I'm abandoning Justin and have purchased a pair of Lucchese Ropers.  They look essentially the same as the Justin 3133s and cost more at the time of purchase, but they're MADE IN THE U.S.A. and from what others have told me they'll last me many times longer than the Justins.  Therefor over the long haul perhaps I'll actually save money.",Quality Issue,Design Issue

"I am not sure that is the correct place to put a review but I shall try anyway.  I have always loved Merrell shoes.  For years!!!  But now...all of sudden, their shoes are getting to be of poor quality.  I think they have become too successful.  I already have 2 pairs of relatively new shoes from Merrell that are falling apart.  I now use one pair that is falling apart and do yard work only....and they are terrible.  I have a second pair that is falling apart and relatively new.  I have spend lots of $100 on Merrell shoes.  I am so disappointed that I have moved to different brands.  I was going to buy the above shoe but told myself that I should not.  As far as I am concerned....they were a 5 and now a 1.  What a shame.............",Design Issue,Quality Issue

"...and a nickle on gluing the sole to uppers as they always start to peel off in the first 6 months or yr. even with only a few hours per week wear. The plastic stiffener failed on one early making the shoe almost impossible to use as the broken end protrudes and stabs into the soft part of my foot.

"These look nice and are comfortable when you're not walking on them, but the tread design doesn't work for me at all. The rubber blisters on the part of my sole that has the heaviest tread (rear instep) wore down flat long before any of the others, which made walking in the shoes noticeably uneven after only like a month of use.",Quality Issue,Design Issue

Nice looking shoe but size issue. I have two other Jungle Mocs: dark brown (bought directly from Merrell online and light brown (bought at local a shoe store).

"I ordered these boots on 11 April 2015, and received them by 14 April. Since that time, I have worn them frequently, finding them comfortable and true-to-size, and I had believed them to be durable.However, I noticed today (10 November 2015) that the stitching on the soles is failing. This is piss-poor performance for a boot from a respected maker - even if I were wearing them every single day (which I've not been), a seven month lifespan on the sole stitching is pathetic.It's possible that the pair I got is defective, but after seeing so many other customers with exactly the same complaint, I think it more likely that this is simply the standard Justin builds to now. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone - if you're willing to live with mediocre boots, they can be had far cheaper.",Design Issue,Quality Issue
I will never buy Justin Boots again.  Within 6 months both soles had worn through.  I contacted Justin Boots and they just said they don't warranty the soles.

"This is not a 12M. My best guess is it's closer to 12EEE, even though the shoe has a ""12M"" label.Merrell seems to have changed actual size of their ""12M"" version of this shoe. The size is much bigger than exact model (""12M Jungle Moc"") manufactured earlier. The product number on the box, and the product number in the shoe, match each other, and they indicate the ""12M"" size. But they are visibly bigger (about 1/4"" wider AND longer) than earlier 12M Jungle Moc's. This is maybe the 6th pair of 12M Jungle Moc's I've purchased from Amazon in the past three years (I wear them out after 4 months and 300 miles of walking). I always order the same size.I would not suggest ordering these online as the size may vary greatly depending on what stock is shipped.Though there is no arch support, the stock insoles are not glued and easily swapped for good orthotics -- a requirement for just about any shoe.",Product Description Issue,Design Issue

"I LOVE Merrell shoes and over the last 6 years or so I've owned like 10 pairs, mostly in the Bare Access or Road Glove line.  I love how light those shoes are and how wide the toe box is.  I always bought size 12 and they always fit well.  I wanted some house shoes and saw these here on Amazon on sale so I bought them.  Sadly these were WAY TOO TIGHT AND NARROW in the toebox in my normal size 12.  I couldn't even wear them for like 10 minutes they were so uncomfortable.  I checked the specs to make sure I didn't get a narrow size on accident, and the pair I got as far as I could tell were standard size 12.  So one size 12 is definitely not comparable to another size 12 in Merrells!  I realize that I've been wearing relatively minimalist shoe with a wide toebox so that's what I'm used to, but honestly I was shocked just how poorly these fit.  I returned them and am still looking.  I haven't lost faith in Merrells -- in fact I'm looking for a hiking shoe from them.  But I'm going to have to *go* to a store to try them on I guess.  Bare Access I just order when they go on sale and they fit reliably.  Oh well.  At least Amazon's return policy is awesome!",Design Issue,Design Issue
"For whatever reason, these shoes make my left foot ache after less than a quarter mile of walking.  They were a bit too big, but it's hard to believe that's the issue when my right foot (which is half a size smaller than my left) was unaffected.  I like the style, and the idea of the design, but it just didn't work for me.  I am returning them.",Design Issue,Design Issue

I am not persuaded that a different size (wide rather than medium) would help, and in any case, I was not satisfied with the quality. There are suede flaps (on both edges of the tongue) that ""hang out,"" lying on top of the elastic strips that fasten the edges of the tongue to the body of the shoe. The suede is VERY thin, flimsy and soon wrinkled (would not lie flat over the elastic) and those wrinkly flaps looked terrible.",Design Issue,Design Issue
"I purchased a pair of these on Amazon.  From day 1, although they were 11's and I usually wear a 10-and a half,  they were too small, cramping my toes and very difficult to get on and off. I know, i know, I should have sent them back immediately, but hey, i figured they would stretch out a bit in a month or so.  WRONG.  They never adapted to my feet and if anything got worse.  Now I am several months out of the warrantee period and they are useless and heading for the trash.  I just received a pair of size 11 Keen Brixens.  They fit comfortably, seem true to size, and appear to be far more waterproof than the Merrell's.  I've always counted on Keen to give me high quality in my hiking sandals and now they are doubling down with a great pair of wet weather boots.  Thanks Keen and boo hoo to Merrell's, good by old pals.",Design Issue,Design Issue
I had high hopes for this shoe given my wife loves the female version. After 10 minutes though my front toe started to hurt though even though there was plenty of room in the front of the shoe. The shoe also tends to push you feet forward in them along with what feels like no arch support as well. This caused my feet to fall inward and did not feel comfortable.,Quality Issue,Design Issue
"I am giving this product 2 stars instead of 1, because they seem like they are extremely well made and will last for a long time, but it has failed in about every other aspect, especially for its price range.1. Does not come even close to fitting, this shoe fits like its 1-2 sizes bigger than stated, and i specifically chose a smaller size to make sure it would fit well.2. it has NO grip on wet ground or rock, it is more slippery than my normal sneakers.3. it purports to prevent odor, but after only wearing them about 5 times,  well lets just say that claim stinks...4. They are easily the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn in this price range, I have even worn $10 shoes that where more comfortable, the backs of these shoes press at an odd angle against my achilles tendon, making it quite sore by the end of the day, and my arch is pretty sore after wearing them as well.5. No real ankle support at all, that is likely do mostly to being so loose though...I honestly just do not understand why such a universally loved shoe and brand has turned out so absolutely horrible, maybe its just me, but these are not worth even half what i payed... i wish i could say different though, as I had high  hopes for these, as I purchased them for work, which includes a lot of varied terrain, I really need a good shoe soon :/",Design Issue,Design Issue

Got a pair for Christmas and was defective: the insole was obviously glued in crooked on the left shoe. (measured from top of arch to top of the shoe and was almost 1/2 inch different than the right shoe). Exchanged for another pair and has exactly the same problem. I love and buy only Merrell shoes and this is the first I have experienced such poor quality control. Hope they haven't changed for the worse.,Quality Issue,Quality Issue
"Update after 3 months of moderate to heavy use (1-2 hours per day on average):The upper has begun separating from the rubber at the toe of the shoe, allowing water to easily get in. It has become so bad that water wets my socks from a walk through a field with morning dew. When I received these, I noticed that there was only a small amount of glue that appeared to hold the rubber outsole to the upper at the toes and it looked pretty precarious. But, I figured that these were Merrell's and they would hold up. I expect more from Merrell and I expect more from an $80 shoe. They are still comfortable, but I am now pretty much restricted to using them indoors only. Based on the other reviews being overwhelmingly positive, I think this defect may be limited to the camo version.Otherwise, this is a nice shoe:Unlike neoprene versions (e.g., Bogs), these slippers are extremely breathable. They keep your feet comfortably warm in the cold (even in single digits), but they don't sweat. To me, there is no worse feeling than your feet shedding sweat nonstop because they can't breathe in your shoes. I will gladly trade the lack of complete waterproof-ness for breatheability. This breatheability also means that these are fine to wear in the summer, whereas those made from neoprene will be unbearably hot.These come in half-sizes. Many similar outdoor slippers do not, which can be a big deal if you wear a half-size. I am an 11.5, not a 12. I walk out of 12s and 11s scrunch my toes. Merrell is smart enough to realize that skipping out on half-sizes will make many people unable to wear these.These slippers are extremely comfortable and easy to slip in and out of. You can feel the cushioning as you walk -- it is firm, but cushioned -- exactly what I want in an outdoor slipper. They provide great traction and grip on all outdoor surfaces, including snow- and ice-covered surfaces.",Quality Issue,Design Issue
"I have put 3-4 layers of Dr Scholls padding around this shoe to make it fit - and it is still a little loose.The length is good, but the area around the ankle is unike any other shoe you have ever tried.

These replaced a pair of Merrill's I have owned for a few years which are blond colored.  They were getting old and I was getting tired of the color.  My old Jungle Moc's are very comfortable to wear.My new black Jungle Moc's seem narrower and tight.  I checked the sizing on my old pair and I ordered the exact same size.  All I know is the new ones are real tight if I wear socks.  I am hoping they will stretch out otherwise I may have spent $80 for nothing.

I think NB tennis shoes have a reputation for being low to the ground, and my 803s were indeed lower than these K-Swiss.  They fit fine, length and width and the toe box was good.

"I am currently ""between shoes"" as Wilson keeps discontinuing every model I've liked. I generally buy shoes that are labeled ""extra wide"". I've worn shoes the manufacturer has called 2E, 3E and 4E. I don't mind wearing more than one pair of socks, in fact I prefer it.I gave this shoe a try because a tennis specific website indicated this was a good choice for wide feet. It isn't. At least not if you need width in the forefoot. I spent several days trying to stretch these guys out and then finally decided I'd made enough progress to give them a shot on the court. It was a painful experience and I really could not play my game with them on.I think the workmanship of the shoe is top notch but the shape is really not foot-like. If you look at a Nike shoe or a Wilson shoe, they are shaped like feet. This shoe is shaped like a canoe. If your feet are shaped like canoes then you've found your shoe.I think on the basis of my experience with these shoes that I like a comfort oriented shoe. The ride in these things is harsh.

"Either the pair of Converse I received from this seller were counterfeit knock-offs or Converse has farmed out their manufacturing to the cheapest country with the poorest of quality standards. I bought this pair of Monochrome Blck All-Star Hi-Tops because it is my favorite style and my current pair was getting worn. When the new pair arrived I took them out of the box and placed them in my closet to be ready when the older pair was completely done. Well, the new pair had sat in my closet for about three weeks until today when I finally needed to wear them and to my dismay I discovered that they were the worst pair of Comverse I had ever seen. I wish I had inspected them better prior to trusting this seller and having thrown away the box so that I could return them. When I attempted to lace up and wear these shoes they felt oddly uncomfortable on my feet as if they were not the correct size and then I noticed the laces were at least 6 inches shorter than the standard All-Star Hi-Top laces. As I neared the top eyelets of the shoes one of the metal rings that surround the eyelets completely fell apart and off of the shoe. That when I took the shoes off and began inspecting them thoroughly. It is than that I noticed excessive glue at every seam as if the shoes were sloppily put together, the rubber emblem patch on the side of the shoe was incorrect and poorly seen on. I started comparing the new shoes to my older pair and not even the insole was correct, it was a completely different color, the new insole was black and the old was white. The actual bottom sole of the shoes were completely different as well with the original and authentic pair displaying the shoe size and the counterfeit pair not. I compared the model numbers of the shoes and they were the only thing that matched but the labels that they were printed on were completely different as well, not only were they different but they were both manufactured in completely different countries. The labels on the heel of the shoes were also completely different. This is the second time I have made a purchase on Amazon and have been shipped a counterfeit item, the last time it was a Carhartt hat that I ordered.

I had to spend an hour sewing velcro on to this costume so that it can actually be worn.  If you don't know how to sew then it is unusable.  If I hadn't opened the package early to have my 3 year old try it on then we wouldn't have a costume for Halloween.,Design Issue,Design Issue
If you don't care what your kid looks like for Halloween then this costume is for you. First of all the material is uncomfortable and if they wear clothes underneath you can see all the creases because the material is so thin. This costume has no shape to it and it makes them look like cheap pajamas.,Quality Issue,Design Issue

"As soon as this costume was delivered, we opened it up because my son was waiting patiently for this costume. Upon examining the costume, we noticed a few things. 1) the letter ""S"" was cracked and peeling off. 2) the Velcro on the back to keep the costume on was only on one side and not two, so it wouldn't close. I have attached pictures of the poor workmanship. My son and we were very disappointed in this costume. It's inexpensive in price and very cheap and put together poorly. I wouldn't buy this again at all. I don't recommend. For those looking for size comparison of this size small, my son is 5.3 years old and the small fits just fine.",Quality Issue,Design Issue

What a disappointment and a hassle!  I will not order from this seller EVER again.  The other odd thing was that the package it came in was shipped directly from China, not from a warehouse in the US that distributes items made in China but actually sent from Shanghai.  I wish there was a way for me to upload a pic of what I was sent.",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue

And several seams are coming undone (from the very first day), so I have to keep sewing them back together. Last year we bought a Buzz Lightyear costume that's still in perfect shape except for some fading from washing and my son has worn it almost everyday for a year.

While technically wearable, it was still itchy as hell and I decided not to torture myself any further, so it became a rag.

I checked them side by side and the stretch is just as strong on the cheapies, and they are half as big before you put them on, length and inches across.  Very disappointed.  If you are heavier or have more leg, they are silky feeling or appearing and you would probably think they are okay.  I think they are way too expensive for what you get.

"I so wanted this bra to be ""the one"", but unfortunately I was very disappointed. First, let me be clear... my breasts are truly a force to behold. I mean, I'm a 38H and it takes a nation of millions to hold them down - or so it seems.  I have had a Freya and Wacoal underwire sports bra that have worked very well in the past, so I know it can be done. When I saw the reviews and the description for this bra, I felt like it might be yet another wonderful one that I could add to the arsenal.  But it was absolutely NOT that bra.  I read tons of reviews regarding the fit and how to measure and I measured myself and purchased a 4.  I was smack in the middle of what should have been a size 4 based on my measurements.  When I received the bra I put it on and the band was obviously the right size, It was difficult to fasten across my breasts - so tight I thought at first it may have been too small, but I was able to fasten the bra and then stuff my breasts into it - maybe not the way they intended to get it on, but hey - whatever works.  When I had it on and positioned my breasts in the cups the first thing I noticed was the significant lack of coverage and spillage out the sides of the bra. I also had monoboob and spillage out of the top. It was just not big enough to contain my breasts. The problem is a size bigger and it would have been way too big in the band.  Also, it had no adjustable straps. I thought it was brand new, and the band was pretty tight, so let me try it out and see how it goes.  So I wore it to my morning workout with my trainer and it was just useless.  It loosens up super fast and I was just bouncing around like a pogo stick. I mean when he said run and give me high knees, he got high breasts too. My breasts were like, ""Seriously?  This is no help at all.""  That's what they said to me after the workout.  I have already worn it so I won't return it.  I guess what I'll do is wear a regular bra under it and wear it on top.  Like so many other times, I end up wearing two bras so as not to waste the money I spent on some inept, unsupportive joke of a bra that my breasts just roll their eyes and shake their head at. Sigh. On to the next.",Design Issue,Design Issue

"I have been wanting a breast reduction for probably as long as I can remember (I'm 43).  Being cursed with an apple body shape and after kids...well the girls have become more troublesome than ever and really are ""in the way"". I ride horses and compete and my instructor had finally mentioned that I really needed something to tame my DD's. And I couldn't agree more!!!  I have tried **everything**, and a good ""stabilizing"" bra is not something I would cut corners on and buy ""cheap"" (those of you with big girls like mine, know that function supersedes beauty and price every time).  I ordered a size 4 as recommenced for my 42DD.  Put it on...which is a major chore, but I certainly did not care about that one bit.  All it achieved for me was create  a large bouncing ""mass"" in front of me. Did NOTHING to control bounce. It was actually horrifying.  I hate a uni-boob- but could live with that if it stabilized and prohibited bounce.  No such luck at all.  It was actually worse.  This huge clumping-bouncing blob in my front looked hideous and offered no function at all. Not what I would have expected from a bra at this price point, advertising what it claims.

But I found it was more comfortable to stand on my hard wood floor in SOCKS than it was to stand around in these shoes.I'm not entirely sure whose idea it was to put a hard layer of stitching right on the back of the ankle, but THIS IS THE WORST THING. My first time wearing them I walked to dinner and back in them - no more than an hour round trip - and on the way back I could barely walk right because the shoes had already torn the skin off the backs of my ankles. Through my socks. I have of course had to wear in shoes before, but you can't wear in something you're afraid to put on again.They do look good. It's a classic sneaker look.

When I got to work on Halloween, I went into the bathroom to put it on, and I couldn't believe how painful the seams were against my skin! Mind, I have very sensitive skin, so while other reviews say it was ""itchy,"" I say it felt like torture. I was wearing yoga pants and a cami under the dress, so it was my shoulders and arms that took the brunt of the scratching.
