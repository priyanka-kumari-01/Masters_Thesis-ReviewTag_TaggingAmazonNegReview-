"Authentic or fake, I don't know; but I can definitely say the New Wayfarers I bought from Sunglass Express are of lower quality than the pair I bought in 2011.Yes, the frames squeak and creak. Even though polarized, the light green G-15 lenses offer little protection from the sunshine. I found myself squinting through my $120 Ray-Bans. That's bogus. I was almost tempted to pop out the lenses and make sure they weren't polycarbonate plastic instead of the crystal green (glass) lenses I had been promised.Strangely enough, the RB2132 Ray-Ban New Wayfarer I bought from Sunglass Express is almost a carbon-copy of the $39.99 Kirkland Abruzzo frame offered by Costco. The only difference between the two is that the Ray-Ban front is flat across, and the bridge of the Kirkland frame is raised.I returned my RB2132s to Sunglass Express.

"I purchased these boots despite the negative commentary regarding the quality of the boot. I had faith that Dansko would never put their name on an inferior product and perhaps the negative reviews were anomalies. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the negative reviewers.The boot's leather quality was awful - it was hard, plastic-like, and absolutely uncomfortable. It felt like I had purchased $9.99 fake leather boots from Walmart. Interestingly, inside the boot where the size was stamped I found a manufacture date of 11th May 2009. I purchased these in November 2010. I have returned these boots and have since found the exact same boot (with current 2010 manufacture date) at a major department store. The leather on these boots is soft, supple, and true to Dansko quality. So beware and check the manufacture date on your boots! With the newer boots I agree with the positive reviewers and find this to be a fantastic, stylish, and comfortable boot.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"One of the posts came bent. It was easy enough to straighten with a pair of pliers, but there's no reason it should have been bent with the way it was packaged.The posts are also way too long. They touch my neck, and if anything touches my earlobe, they stab into me.And the jewelry looks gaudy. If you have small earlobes like me, they dwarf them. The stones look like fake, cloudy plastic in any sort of light. I've had another pair of cz earrings that sparkled and were clear, so I'm certain this is not how all fake diamonds look.I'm chalking it up to wasting money on the hit and miss of ordering online, but I'm very disappointed that these were as terrible as they are with how good the reviews were. I'd planned to order two more sets from this same brand, but am now skeptical that all their product is as low-quality as this pair turned out to be.EDIT: I'm bumping the review down to one star. I wore these for a bit and really tried to like them, but it turns out I'm allergic to whatever metal this is. I'm not allergic to silver.

"I am a fool. I read the reviews regarding how poorly made these jewelry armoires were and did not listen because it is the only large armoire I could find with the kind of earring storage I wanted and I currently own a smaller SEI jewelry box and, though it is obviously not high-end, it is well constructed. The price was okay and seriously, how bad could it be!?Amazon shipped out super fast and it was well packaged. I took it out and noticed right away that the finish was cheap. The cherry color is pretty fake looking and a little too red for my tastes. And it was noticeably sloppy in a couple areas. Alright, it's not beautiful... but it's going in my closet, so I decided to assemble it anyway and give it a chance. I'm pretty handy... maybe a few adjustments and it would be fine.The legs went on perfectly, so far so good. Upon standing the thing up, however, I noticed that the doors did not align properly. I figured this might be due to a few screws not being tightened all the way, so I checked and actually the screw holes are already stripped from the doors pulling away during shipping... you'd have to add wood putty to get them to stay. Doable, but what a pain. And upon closer examination, the hinges themselves seemed pretty flimsy... not a good sign.Next I checked the earring racks. The design on these is really cool and it is a darn shame this is so poorly made. Each earring rack swings forward so you can get easy access to your earrings. Also, they used slits instead of holes so you can easily slide your earrings onto the racks which is especially nice for post earrings. BUT each rack is installed un-evenly which means some of the magnets that hold them in place are too powerful and some don't work at all. Not fixable.On to the drawers. They are small. And they smell bad. I'm guessing from the glue. 2 of the drawers had small rips in the liners and 3 of them had uneven glueing. Again: sloppy. And the liners are so thin, that would not be an easy fix. I'd have to replace them entirely. None of the drawers have stops and they come out all the way pretty easily. Except for the bottom drawer... couldn't get that one to open. Turns out it's stuck on the mounting hardware underneath. Meh.Perhaps if I'd gotten this on Craigslist for $50... or as a gift from someone else, I wouldn't be so disappointed. It is certainly functional and if you get really lucky and end up with one without all of the assembly sloppiness, it would be okay. But given the reviews I've seen here combined with my own experience, it's a gamble. So, for how much I paid... I think it should have been in far better shape. It's going back.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"I ordered these Bearpaw boots because of the great price. As you can see, the title says, BEARPAW Women's Eva 12 Shearling Boot, Sand. I figured they were being sold cheap because they are a discontinued Bearpaw line. After I placed my order, I noticed the item description on my invoice Bearpaw Women's T410-W Evan **FAUX FUR** 12 Boot. I decided to continue with the order since it was a good price and the actual product description only said SHEARLING; never mentioned anything about FAUX FUR or fake shearling fur. Unfortunately my amazon invoice turned out to be accurate. This boot IS made with fake fur - not real shearling - contrary to the amazon product title and description. If you're looking for a genuine shearling boot, this pair isn't the one for you. I tried on the boots when they arrived and they felt very stiff and uncomfortable to walk in.

"A convincing fake, but still a fake. If having the real thing is important for you, DON'T buy from amazon.

Maybe I got unlucky or maybe this isn't the real deal. It looked beautiful but after 2 weeks of use the stitching started to unravel across a third of the bottom making it unusable. I took it into a Fjallraven location and they were a bit hesitant because I had not bought it on their website but let me swap it for a new one.

i received a fake bag,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"This bag is a fake. I ordered it in the yellow color and it arrived. The fabric felt cheap and the color didn't match other pictures. There were a few threads loose and the cut on the seat pad was very rough. I examined the logo and the zippers and the tags-- they all matched what the real Kanken exactly. But I took it to the Fjallraven store and compared it to their real bag. The fabric on real bag felt thicker and more durable. The color was also richer and more vibrant. The quality of the stitching was much better. The real one felt like a good bag for the price. The bag I bought on amazon was obviously a fake when compared to the original kanken. If you order a Kanken and it feels cheap, it is most likely a fake. Order your Kanken on the fjallraven website, on Nordstroms, or go to a Fjallraven store. I love my genuine Kanken. It fits everything (the 11.9 inch iPad Pro, headphones, a book, a jacket, a water bottle, a sketchbook and some pens, and more) and is comfortable to wear. The yellow colored bag does get dirty simply because it is a light color. I have yet to clean it but at the Fjallraven store they said it can be easily cleaned using Mr Clean magic erasers (which are found on amazon). It is sturdy, surviving numerous airport trips. Overall a great bag when bought from a trusted source (I give the genuine bag five stars). It is worth returning the fake bag (one star) and spending the money on a genuine Kanken.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

Another thing is the foam pad that comes with the backpack wouldn't go back into the compartment it came in, and also curled up (again irrevocably).I ended up getting a kanken from the actual store, and the padding is visibly thicker and so is the backpack material.

I thought maybe it was just because they were new and I needed to wear them in and stretch the fabric out a little bit... nope! Another thing I should have caught was that the color is way off.

"I ordered an 8 1/2 (I can usually wear an 8 or 8 1/2). They sent me one shoe that was a 9 and one shoe that was a 10!! The 9 was tight...fit like a 7 1/2 - 8. The 10 had a good quarter inch gap at my heel. They look like Tom's...even the box looks authentic (in reference to those saying these are fakes/knockoffs). I've never owned a real pair of TOMS, so I cannot tell if they're real or not. One other reviewer mentioned a TM mark vs. TOM's R mark. The ones I received do not have ANY mark at all...beside the name TOMS or beside the name SKECHERS! There is a tag hooked on with a TINY circle mark by the name Skechers....I had to get a magnifying glass out to see what was inside the circle. I don't know, but to ME, it looks like a star or the letter M. So....without having an authentic pair next to these to compare to, I'd still guess that they're indeed knockoffs. Not sure how well they'll hold up. No one else would be able to tell by glancing at them on your foot that they're not real TOMS, but purchasing these, defeats the purpose of your purchase helping someone less fortunate have a pair of shoes on their feet! But.... if you end up purchasing these anyway, I'd order up one size. Oh, and the Ash ones I ordered are a dark greyish taupe....loved the color...a great neutral. Too bad I don't trust them now.

We're here Monday through Friday from 6:00am to 4:30pm Pacific time.DianaLevi Strauss & Co.Consumer RelationsCase ID: 4109284So, to add insult to injury, they came out with a new jean, 505 straight to replace the discontinued 505 Regular Fit, and then when people complained, they just said F.U. and changed the name of the new ones to 505 Regular Fit.I have filed a complaint with the BBB for false advertising and misrepresenting an item. I doubt it will do any good, but this is just a bunch of BS!!!!!!**Update** Febraury 2015So, now the Levi's web site for any 505 regualr fit says sits at waist and when I looked at some in a local store, the tag says sits at waist. Unfortuantely, there are still only 5 belt loops, inconsistant material, different colors of thread bewteen the outside pocket stiching and the across-the- pocket stiching (was yallow isntead of gold/orange) and in some cases, tiny shallow front pockets.It appears they have changed only enough of the details back to avoid a law suit, but the jeans are still not what we all want. I guess I will continue to buy Wranglers, even though I hate them, because they have everything the fake Levi's 505 Regular Fit don't...",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"These jeans are obviously fake, the first pair that I opened (steely blue) seem to be made of a stretchy material, I have worn Levi's for most of my adult life and have never had a pair of jeans that were made of this material, I thought I could live with the stretch material pants until today (Aug 1, 2016 I came home and my wife told me that the other pair of pants had already ripped at the back left pocket, that convinced me that these are fake jeans. I would obviously give the seller a chance to make it right, and will change my review if I just happened to get two bad pairs.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
I reordered this product. The same size and model. I even used the Amazon order again feature . The jeans I received are 4 inches longer in length than my old pairs. And the waist is an inch smaller than my old pairs. All of the labelling between the old and new jeans are the same. I feel that I can't count on Amazon for Levis anymore . I don't know if these are faulty or if they are simply fake Levis . It's a bummer that I can't count on Amazon for my jeans anymore .,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"Ok, these pants fit pretty much the same as my old 505s did, but they are NOT the quality jeans I expected. The fabric is thinner and scratchier, there are fake pockets on the back (strange and poorly sewn), and most of the hardware does not have the levis logo on it like the original. Seems like a pair I could buy on the street at a steep discount overseas. I am keeping them because they do fit and I need a knockabout pair for cleaning up after the animals at the SPCA, but I won't be buying these online next time.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

He call customer service and they told him if he sent it with a check for $36.50 and wait 6 wks for it they would replace everything, well i was happy until one month later and it started again and then the clasp broke, so now i guess i will have to pay another $40 when i could of bought a fake one and atleast had less moneny in it in the long run. i really love this watch and have had so many compliments on it but hate to know that they won't stand by their product, they said they have had people complain about that same problem....hello, am i missing something?",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Well, I'm rather surprised that this is being sold under the pretense of being real 10k Gold, when it is just some rip off.

"I did not received the product I expected and it was poorly made. First, the description indicates that it is sheep skin and my expectation (and the picture) indicate that it is constructed of shearling. However, the shoes were lined in fake fur, less puffy than in the photo. Second, I had the same issue mentioned by several people in the reviews that the foot padding was high or uneven and caused their feet to slide to the side. However, in my case the right foot fit perfectly and the left had the issue and caused my foot to slip off to the left (I twisted my ankle slightly while trying to walk on them). Needless to say, I don't have this issue with other shoes or slippers. It was clear that the memory foam lining was poorly cut on one show and there was no padding on the outside of the shoe. So basically cheap and poorly made slippers, with no quality control -- especially for the price.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

Really do your research when buying the boots. I brought these for my boyfriend but he never even say them because I immediately knew they were fake. The boots were stained two totally different colors. The seal around the bottom of the boot was sloppy you could clearly see the glue and Timberland is known for neatness.

"Not the bag advertised!As many other reviewers have written, I was also seeking the Small Classic 6x9x17 as advertised. I paid an extra $150+ to order the bag from The Jungle Store, because they specifically claimed to sell the much sought after Classic Small AmeriBag, 9 wide. Nine inches.But it's a fake out. They shipped the newly designed 11 wide bag that so many people have complained about. This really bothers me. The Jungle Store must know that customers want the older, classic small bag, and they used those magic words in their Amazon ad. They also claimed 6x9x17 in the product description, quite incorrect.But they shipped me the much bigger, heavier, 11 bag.My sweetie is a small woman who loves her old beat-up Small Classic Nylon AmeriBag. I wanted to get her an updated beautiful leather replacement. Not to be.I noticed that other sellers had the larger redesigned leather AmeriBag for only $118.00, but they listed the real width of 11. So I foolishly bought the bag from The Jungle Store which claimed to have the bag in the more desirable 9 wide size, paying over $150 more for the size I wanted. They got my money. And I do NOT have the bag I expected.As others have noted, this oversized bag is well made, good looking. In my opinion the leather is slightly too thin to be the full grain leather, more likely a very nice top grain leather. It is a really nice bag. If only it were the real Small Classic bag.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
I ordered these for my boyfriend. They looked good when they arrived and my boyfriend liked them. He did put them in the box and did not wear for some time.

"The Corset is pretty to Look at But useless to me. I am a 32-C and even finding regular bras that are affordable can be Challenging b/c it's a rare and unusual size. It's assumed that if you are a 32 and Reasonably busty, you probably have fake D or DD cup boobs. If it's all natural then you must be a B cup or smaller -_- SO Finding lingerie and even clothing can be a challenge sometimes.In the cheapie (charlotte Ruse and other) stores I am almost ALWAYS an extra small in tops and knock-off corsets so I figured the 32 corset should be a good fit right? Boy was I WRONG!! The waist and the hips are fine, but even with a bra underneath the bust is HUGE!! Another person who made a review Mentioned the bust thing before. She was a 34 and had to go down to a 32, but what am I supposed to do? They don't have a size 30 so obviously I will have to go through all the trouble of getting my money/ future credit back. I can promise you my 32 corset is at Least a 34! It was sooo huge that I had at least a 2 inch gap between my Chest/ Armpits/ Back All around. If You still want to risk it and buy this thing, definitely go a band size down.

I have NOT yet received my credit back on my DISCOVER card, & yesterday the UPS truck pulled-in my driveway with ""return labels"" to ship-back the watch that I never got.  I had 2 TXT messages on my cell phone from Amazon telling me to contact my local UPS so I could ""PICK-UP"" my watch?????  I don't think so.

This review is 100% only on the actual company these boots are sold by BareBones WorkWear since I have yet to receive my order. I ordered these boots on 12/3 for my son for Christmas - he loves cowboy boots and totally worn his old pair out so these looked like a great choice for him. According to the original order after having to pay for shipping I received notification that the item would ship between 12/7-12/10 with an estimated delivery date of 12/12-12/17. On 12/18 after not receiving I went online with Amazon and selected contact seller sent email and waited for a response. On 12/19 I still had not heard so I emailed another time. After not hearing again I tried to call them several times. I finally was able to talk to someone at Barebones who told me they had a glitch in their computer and several orders never went thru mine included. She said she would process the order but it would not be received by Christmas - the best they could do is 3 day shipping and that would be after the 24-48 hrs it would take for the warehouse to get the order ready. So I asked why it couldn't be overnighted?? And get this - they could not overnight because the shiping charge would end up costing them more than the item itself HAHA SERIOUSLY --- that is so not my problem. I think they owe it to there customers to make the situation right given that they could still get that gift to us so it could be under the tree by Christmas. Thanks for listening to me vent. Hope this doesn't reflect on how the quality of the boots are since their customer service has little to be desired.

I had an amazon driver drive through our property tonight at 10:30pm with his headlights off and just his orange parking lights on. I only noticed him because of the flashlight he was shining that was incidentally coming through our windows from his vehicle while the driver was trying to locate the house number. We live at the end of a private lane, the length of a football field, in a heavily wooded area.Obviously, knowing that my neighbors wouldn't be snooping on my property with flashlights and their car running with its lights off, I grabbed a baseball bat and ran downstairs and out the front door. The driver had dropped someone else's package on my front door and saw that I had come outside. He started to drive away until I put the bat down and started waving and holding the package in the air. He eventually felt confident enough I wasn't going to beat him and returned and got the package back from me to take to the right house.Long story short, I sincerely hope these covert, late-night delivery tactics weren't actually approved and communicated by Amazon, because it will undoubtedly wind up with someone getting seriously hurt eventually.",Product Authenticity Issue,Delivery and Return Issue

"This isn't a review of the shoes but Amazon's business practices. I've been waiting for these shoes for 3 months. They keep pushing my delivery estimate back. They said the shoes are back ordered.

The ugg protective spray damaged the boot and the coloring of the suede was rubbing off in HUGE amounts and it stained the boot.  Also the synthetic lining that is fake, it's rough and pulls out and the left boot was tighter than the right boot.  Also the numbers on the box do not match the numbers on the tag inside the boot and there is no hologram.  I am so disappointed, especially with how much I shop with amazon.  I don't mind buying knock offs, but when I'm paying the price for authentic uggs than I expect the quality of authentic uggs.  Before I return I am bringing the boots by a authorized ugg dealer to ask if these are indeed ""fakes"".",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"I ordered three pairs of Ugg's from Amazon this winter. Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake.  The fake Ugg's had the holographic tag, came in a box with a holographic sticker, and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED.  The boot itself smelled fine, like sheepskin, but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals. I could smell it before I'd even pulled them out of the box.  Real Ugg's do not have this smell.  Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself. If you receive Ugg's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic... return them, they are not authentic.  If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies... it's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots, Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs (apparently they now are), however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are.  If you visit Ugg's website, you can find a list of authorized sellers.  Unfortunately, as I discovered, several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor.  So be careful.  Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $180 for the classic tall.  You will not find authentic Ugg's on sale, reduced, or anything like that at any authorized site.  If you want real Ugg's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland, Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer.  I love my Ugg's. I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow.  My toes were toasty warm.  Very comfortable.  I'm very happy!",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"This watch was extremely disappointing. The packaging was fantastic. Sad to say that if the best part of a product is the packaging. The watch was not heavy. The band felt cheap and thin. The buttons on the side were locked and would not press in. The main button to pull out to adjust the time was frozen in place. For the price, I suppose I got what I paid for. While I was trying to figure out the buttons, one came unscrewed and fell out. I could not get it to go back in place either. This has to be the cheapest watch I've ever encountered. I've seen fake watches on the street that operated and felt better than this one. Save your time and money and do not buy products from this company. I will never purchase another Invicta Watch of any kind ever again. Purchased a nice Seiko once I returned this junky watch.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"My pair of Clarks arrived last week.  When I took the shoes out of the box, I wasn't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes (like I thought) or a cut-down version of a boot.  I went back and looked at the picture on-line and, sure enough, I got what I ordered.  This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe.  With the four eyelets, this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit, plus it looks goofy. The leather, if it really is leather, looks fake.  I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered.  I also would never wear these shoes with jeans (if you do, wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek).  All in all, I give the product a 2.  I would send them back, but it's not worth the bother.  Instead, I'll wear'em when I work in the yard.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Purchased these in October of 2014 and I'm ready to throw them out. While they are comfortable in general, I have two issues. The outer sole or tread if you will is not durable and is wearing out. The biggest problem is the foot bed is covered with some material that does not appear to be leather. It attracts dirt and leaves which stick to the stuff requiring me to take the sandals off and scrape the debris out. On true leather sandals debris such as small twigs, stones and bits of leaf will just fall out. Recently I've noticed the fake leather material is lifting away from the foot bed, becoming loose and clumping. Clarks that I've owned in the past have been very durable and held up for several years but not these.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"I was sent a fake pair of Clark's with my first order, which ran far too large,  so I returned them for the next size down. Amazon then sent me a true pair of Clark's in the next size down, but it was WAY too small. Needed these for work, and spent a few weeks shipping back and forth to try and find the right size.Not sure how or why I was sent a fake pair the first time I ordered them, but be weary when ordering through this store on Amazon. I usually love Clark's, they typically fit great and are quite comfortable. Perhaps I just hit some bad luck with my orders, but I had to. Give two stars just because of my results.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"I have to preface this review by saying that my rating is based on a standard. I purchased this exact belt 12 years ago in 2006. I have worn that belt nearly every day or every other day since, implying that I conservatively have worn this belt for 2,190 10-14 hour days. That belt is in relatively good shape still. Additionally, the leather is still quite beautiful. I've worn it in torrential downpours, at paint parties, etc. This belt has literally seen it all. It is also probably one of the oldest garments that I still wear to this day.With all of that being said, when I decided that I wanted to order another one to keep in case the older one was destroyed or worn away somehow, and received the belt that came from Amazon, I was flabbergasted. The new version of this belt is HORRID. I purchased a black leather Tommy Hilfiger belt two years ago, and was disappointed in the quality... I figured I just bought a belt that they had outsourced the manufacturing to some crap shop to sell in Macy's. The 2018 brown belt has the exact same vinyl-feeling surface as the black belt has. I've attached a bunch of photos comparing the new and old brown belts, as well as the black belt, with two years of wear (and this one I wore maybe 1-3 days a week for the past two years (208ish 10-14 hour days of wear)). You can see that the newer ones have this fake vinyl stuff covering the fronts (if you take the belt and bend it the opposite way you'd bend it if it were being wrapped around one's waist, you can see the surface material bunch up. Genuine leather does not allow air to accumulate under such a thin layer and bunch up that layer. There is indeed genuine leather on the backside of the belt, but it's bonded to this fabric inner-core which is covered with this fake vinyl stuff. I guess that means the manufacturers can call it ""genuine leather"". They should have to specify what % of genuine leather the ""leather"" parts of the product are.Basically, two out of two tommy hilfiger belts I have purchased in the past two years have not been genuine leather as I've come to expect from their 12 year old product. I'm done shopping the brand. :( RIPEveryone's gotta lower prices while maintaining margins, and I understand that. I just have a very hard time when a product goes from a higher quality manufacturing process/material down to one that is an entirely different category.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"I have worn Sambas religiously since 1995. I LOVE them. My third pair is wearing thin in the sole after 8 years of constant wear, so I thought I'd order a replacement pair. These are horrendous. I'm pretty sure they're fake. I really hope they're fake because I can't believe Adidas would downgrade their classic shoe so drastically.

"Yes, these are Cole Haan's. Yes, they're the Pinch Penny (non-Nike Air). Yes, they're a good price. However, this pair is a step down from the identical shoe I have owned maybe a dozen pairs of over the past 25 years.First, I have always loved these shoes. The Pinch series were absolutely made for my feet. Classic styling, durable Brush-Off leather uppers, cushioned leather lining, great fit and superb comfort, unlike most Johnston Murphy's I have tried.I've long been dubious of CH's move to Indian manufacturing of the Pinch series, and this pair confirmed why. The US-made shoe (gone for about 15 years) was of quality non-par. The Mexican-made products that followed were nearly as good. However, now they come from India, and the shoe sucks!This is the first CH shoe I have owned that does not have a combination leather/rubber heel. These have a full rubber heel, with an affectatious grove molded into it where the leather to rubber joint used to be. Not that it really matters to most people, except die-hard Cole Haan buyers like me. The all rubber heel adds nothing to its durability, and the fake groove actually makes the shoe look like a cheap knock-off.Beyond that, the previous meticulous moc-toe stitching now is bunched and slightly uneven, and the lower portion of the toe box appears to have been stitched to the sole in a twisted manner. The leather soles on this pair were cracked and wrinkled at the leading edge of the heel, giving them an extremely cheap appearance.These are not your father's Pinch Penny. They are simply mediochre examples of the attention to detail that we have come to expect of Cole Haan shoes. I promptly returned mine and will shop locally for a pair that is a better example of the company's former level of workmanship.NOTE  -If you don't find this review helpful, please leave a comment and tell me why.

But, the product I got, there the head of the letter ' R ' was equally thing through out its length. And the print is also slightly larger if I am not wrong.Later I found the followings:1) It did not have the square shaped sticker bar-code on the paper box.2) In the nose shoe there is no 'R.B' rather there is 'R B' and the seller intentionally scratched the noes shoe so that it become unreadable.3) In the left leg part of the white print is already gone.4) Moreover, I am writing about a feature. May be this is not correct cause I could not find this feature over internet but discovered myself.

Not the real thing.  These shoes are faker then fake.  Ecco shoes are real leather and when I got these shoes in the mail they did not feel like leather at all they are made out of cardboard.  I bought the same pair at an ecco store 5 years ago and still have them and I still wear them. I got the ones on amazon a few months ago and already they are ripping and these and it seems like these are glue together because they falling apart at the heals.  What I learn here is to not buy brand stuff on line because you will probably get pirate stuff fake stuff.  Always buy at the store even if you have to pay more at least you will see if you are getting the real stuff.,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

I ordered a deluxe Quidditch robe elsewhere and was convinced I had been sent the economy version. It was made of thin cheap looking fake 'crushed velvet' polyester.

"I had to return these boots twice. The first time it was because the size I purchased was too small. The second time was because of a defect in the boot. The pull was attached inside at an angle which meant the leather underneath the tab (what the tab is attached to) was sticking out and scratching my calf, also that piece underneath had mesh fabric glued on, the kind you see on underneath fake leather (I'm not saying it was fake, I honestly didn't look too hard). The sole was attached sloppily in obvious layers with unglued pieces sticking out, it looked awful. After the second return I decided to get a refund and drive over and get them at Boot Barn. I looked at the same boots and noticed some pretty obvious and disturbing differences. The boots I got from Amazon had no square Frye patches sewn inside over both pull straps plus the online pull straps were longer. The sole of these boots were not layered like the mail order boots, it has one piece of leather above a thick sole of oil resistant rubber. The quality is outstanding and defect free. Also the Frye logo is in a different spot and angled not straight up and down like the online pair. I checked three pair of boots and they were identical with regard to placement, etc. The harness strap is also longer, it doesn't go around the ankle like the Amazon pair. Instead it falls about 3/4"" above the heel, the new boots weigh much less with much softer, more flexible cowhide. The online also didn't come in a Frye box (not sure this matters since Boot Barn just puts them in one of their store bags, no box at all). I'm not usually a whiner and I don't think I've ever given a one star review, or one this long. But I've been buying Frye's since I was in high school and that's about forty years. I've got five pair now, the oldest is twenty-five, they last forever, I just resole them, clean them up and they're right as rain. So maybe Amazon's are the real thing and it's just coincidence that I just got two lousy pair, or maybe they were the real thing but the price was good because they're seconds, or maybe they're counterfeit.

"Update: I emailed their customer support and they verified that these don't have memory foam.  Their reply was that the wool material is constructed in a way to provide comfort support however, after a few months of relatively light use the wool is so compacted that it feels as hard as the floor and offers no padding at all.I haven't worn slippers since I was a kid and I was surprised at how difficult it was to find a decent pair.  Our poorly insulated apartment was getting colder than usual and Ive been experiencing a lot of discomfort in the heels of my feet the past year so I was looking for a slipper with decent padding (our floors are fake wood and tile) that would keep my feet warm without getting too sweaty.  I tried on numerous slippers at various department stores and discovered that I didn't like any of the cheap under $20 pairs which tend to be all synthetic and have no padding.  I also didn't like the next level up which usually have some sort of memory foam.  Maybe I weigh too much (185 lbs) but as soon as I step on memory foam it feels like it compresses all the way to the floor and starts hurting my feet.  These Tamarac by Slippers International Men's Cody Sheepskin Slippers cost way more than I originally wanted to spend but they use actual leather and wool and feel high quality when you slip them on.  Because they're wool, they keep my feet warm without making them moist.  Its weird because my feet feel like they're getting sweaty but when I take off the slippers they are dry to the touch.  Maybe this is a function of wool?  This is my first pair of wool slippers so I wouldnt know.  The descriptions says they have a memory foam footbed but it must be a very thin layer or an incorrect description.  The padding is less than I wanted, more like a pair of Vans slip-ons, and I cant stand in them for more than an hour but this is true of any shoe I put on these days.  I might have to go orthopedic. Ive accidentally forgotten I had them on when taking out the trash a few times but because they have a regular shoe sole, it was fine.  Aesthetically, I like that they don't look like moccasins, loafers or Crocs.  I really like them and would give four stars if they had real padding in the footbed.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

I always buy 10 1/2 XE (US 3 E) and they have always been GREAT, until I bought these 2 pair from Elite Hero.  I always bought them before from a major US retailer, but they didn't have them anymore.  The difference was astonishing.  They were very TIGHT, and the materials looked inferior (but not enough that I can initially cry foul, the proof should come with wearing).  Also the leather upper is VERY hard on these now.  Elite Hero has assured me that Propet has told them that Propet had not lowered the quality of the shoes (one of my first concerns along with were they knock-offs i.e. fakes).  I have contacted Propet 3 times, but have not received a reply yet.  Another question that I have, is since they are China made and other Companies have complained of Chinese manufacturing NOT putting in the specified materials, could there be a manufacturer issue.  Specifically has the manufacturer, without Propet knowledge or approval, changed the materials or shorted the materials (e.g. smaller than specified shoe size) to save on cost and improve profit?

"UPDATE!!I was fully prepared to come back and change this review, I kept thinking maybe Nike changed the kind of rubber they used on the soles, but today I got my genuine Converse Chuck Taylor's direct from Nike/Converse's Web site, and the difference is staggering. The shoes ordered from Amazon/Red Pine Hill are 100% fake, no questions asked. The fakes came in a very real looking Converse Box, had all the right markings, but we're made in a different country, and had a different kind of rubber sole (thicker, and softer), and no cloth layer on the bottom of the sole like traditional chucks. They were very high quality fakes, clearly they took a mold of a real chuck and made the shoe from that mold, but probably made by slave labor in a sweat shop, and would have fallen apart a lot faster. FIND AN AUTHORIZED DEALER OF NIKE/CONVERSE! DO NOT BUY THESE FAKES ON AMAZON.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I am confident that the shoes I received from Red Pine Hill were not genuine converse but some imported knock offs being sold for full price. I have owned countless chuck taylors over the years, and never once was I so confused when I first picked up a shoe as when these first arrived. The rubber sole material is not standard converse sole material, but a cheaper grade of rubber. there was no traditional cloth under wrapping on the rubber sole, and the all-star patch on the side was not sewn on as well as the one on my old pair that I was planning to retire.

"Oddly enough, I've ordered these three times.  The first time, I was delighted with the sunglasses I received (~April 2015); it was the first time in my life I bought a pair of sunglasses that didn't come from a rotating display in a drug store.  The quality was outstanding, and I could wear them all day long without discomfort.  Alas, I waded into the ocean while wearing my beloved sunglasses, and a freak wave knocked me to the ocean floor, losing my glasses forever.I re-ordered the exact same pair from Amazon.  Immediately I could tell something was amiss: instead of the black matte finish, these were shiny plastic.  They also crinkled if your torqued them in the slightest, as though the seems between the lens and the frame didn't fit properly.  The hinges of the arms were stiff and squeaked.  Worst of all, they pinched my temples fiercely, and couldn't be worn for more than 20 minutes consecutively.  They weren't obvious fakes, but the low quality and worrisome details led me to complain and request a replacement pair.Happily, Amazon complied, and with some trepidation I opened the replacement package two days later, and the new new sunglasses matched the first pair.  So, there's a happy ending.  Still, very worrisome that you can order the exact same product three times and get such dramatically different qualities.

The shoes that I received were not true Adidas Copa Mundials. I have purchased these cleats many times in my life. It's my go to cleats of all time. I could tell they were fake by the feel of the leather, the misplacemenf of the silver Copa Mundial label on the shoes as well as the tongue missing the leather shoelace holder.  It is not comfortable and def not kangaroo leather. The cleat is also missing nylon lining on the inside. The sole is hard plastic that is not flexible at all with cheapplastic pegs for cleats. The more I look and feel this shoe the more I realize how fake it is.I would rather purchase my cleats from the Adidas website but they do not have my size 4.5!!!!!!!!!

"This watch seems fake.  I bought this watch to replace another casio watch (this one  ASIN: B000GB0FXU) that I destroyed by accident and wanted this one to replace it.  It weighs a lot less than my old one, the ""light"" is worthless, and the buttons are near impossible to press.  Plus the program functions on the watch are completely different than any casio I have ever had.  Was going to return it as soon as I got it but it wouldn't let me do it through Azon and it required me to call a number, I never called.  It is now past the date apparently for a return.

They infact have screws in the hinges, which Oakleys never does. They have made in china stamped on the inside of arms, all Oakleys are made in U.S.A. The paint on the O over ears rubbed off easily, fakes use a screen printing process that rubs off easy. The warranty card isn't even included, it has a cheap piece of paper with no contact information on it, not the plastic card included on real oakleys.

"I really don't like the latest trend to huge watches. I don't wear a watch for fashion, but I like to wear something nice that will last.I really like the look of a Rolex Submariner, and I even considered a replica (fake) Rolex for a while, but I'm really not a fake rolex kinda guy. Then I saw these, which I admit look a lot like the Rolex, but they are not replicas, or fakes. They are genuine Invictas.The watch looks great. It's a nice size and not too heavy. I've had it a week and I'm very happy with it. IF you are real stickler for details, note that the second hand doesn't always line up exactly with the minute lines on the dial face. And one morning, I found the date number only half way advanced between a 09 and a 10. I just tapped the side of the case and it went to the correct display.I give it a 5 based on the fact that it's a $58 watch, and I think it delivers a real bargain at that price.UPDATE November 2014: Might take one star away due to two things - one of the strap pins broke and the watch fell right off my wrist. Thankfully, on to a carpet rather than into the water. Also, sometimes it seems that the day/date gets confused, or doesn't change at midnight. Still, a nice watch for the price.UPDATE MARCH 2016: Now taking away three stars. The watch band broke again, and the watch fell on the floor. The hands all came loose, so they just flopped around. Invicta has a 5 year warranty, but they want $28.00 shipping. That is more than half the price I paid originally ($58), so I'll pass on that. Invicta watches are just too cheaply made. And, I didn't wear it every day. It really had little use. Compare that with the $15 plastic Casio I have that has endured 4 seasons in Antarctica, and still works perfectly.At this point, I have to revise my rating to two stars.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"I initially loved this wallet- but really what I loved is my ORIGINAL Hobo from 10 years ago- so after recent news on this- I have edited my review.I have had a Hobo Lauren wallet for going on 10 years now, and I absolutely love it! It's held up and looks great still after YEARS OF DAILY USE.I purchased this wallet here on Amazon for a friend this time around, same price as my last, and shows that it ships from Hobo directly. When I got the wallet in, it wasn't packaged as well as I remember (literally wrapped in plastic like a $10 wallet would be) but I wrapped it and gifted it anyway. That was in January of this year.I recently just last week happened to see my friend while she was in town and was HORRIFIED to see her wallet and it's condition- and mind you, she actually told me she just started using it in September, not January when I gave it to her, after the change of season. The ""leather"" (I put it in quotes because I've never seen real leather wear this quickly) has already started peeling off. As I looked closer, and compared it to my 10 year old Hobo, there are many details that I found that really make me feel that A) this is 100% a fake Hobo Or B) Hobo has dramatically and horribly lowered the quality of their products and textiles.I'm sick to my stomach to think that I spent $110 on a wallet that hasn't even lasted a couple of months, when I specifically invested that money thinking it would last her a decade like it did me. I'm more disgusted that I can't return it through Amazon due to it being a gift and me not knowing the condition, however I will be filing a formal complaint.Also, to lable this is a ""vintage"" Hobo when it is clearly not, is a BAIT AND SWITCH.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"I guess I'm the sucker, because these are horrible!!  I've been meaning to give these a bad review since the third week I had them, and they've only gotten worse.The lenses do not have the crystal clear vision I get with other polarized glasses. Even worse, they scratch if you look through them sideways. I am a photographer and very careful about how I handle and clean my glasses, but these got scratched up right away.The frames are made of some sort of plastic that reacts to sweat, so the temples are always covered with a white crud that is impossible to  get off. I finally quit trying. They lasted less than three months before they were ugly pieces of junk.Ray Bans and Serengetis last me for years, as did my old pair of Oakleys, years ago. Not these. In fact, I now routinely reach for the 10-year old Serengetis these were supposed to replace -- because they are in better shape than these Oakleys, even though both pairs get the exact same treatment.Either these are fake, or this company has seriously gone down hill. I can't imagine knock-offs performing any worse than these.I was going to replace the lenses and put up with the ugly frames -- figuring I would use them for work and stuff. But the replacement lenses from Oakley cost more than these glasses.Bottom line, they're Oakleys, so if you want glasses to impress other people, these will do it. If you want glasses that will impress you, I suggest you look elsewhere.These also have an odd fit. They are a bit wide for me at the face, but the temples squeeze my head hard enough to become uncomfortable after an hour or so. I'm going to take the blame for that, maybe I just have an oddly shaped head.

I saw other pictures of the same model that wasn't Photoshopped.  However, I bought it anyway hoping I could work with in to make it look more natural.  Unfortunately, there's no way to blend it into your scalp.  The only thing you can do is cover it up with a headband, elf crown or something.

"I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday.  He absolutely loved it out of the box but within weeks the black started chipping off the band and then the mesh band was actually unraveling.  It unraveled so much that at one point there were stray wires poking out that actually cut both of us.  I contacted the company about 5 weeks after he started wearing it and was told that I had to ship (at my own expense) to get it repaired under warranty.  After about 5 months of silence I finally get an email that says, please send us 35 dollars for a new band and another 4 for shipping.  The guy on the phone (from dreamshopee, Amazon vendor) was practically screaming at me on the phone.  Either these watches are so delicate that they can't be worn for daily life or this guy is running a scam and selling fake watches.  He called me from a New Jersey number and as a NY resident I told him I'd just come and pick it up.  He refused to tell me where he was located.  I called Amazon to try and get my money refunded so that I could just buy him a different watch and they're just being difficult, saying that I'm outside of my 90 day window to complain.

"I have real Jack Rogers to compare these to, and these are fakes. You can tell by comparing the two, as seen side by side in the pictures. (Note the nail holes in the heal on one and not the other, the flowers on the heals spaced too far...). But also, right out of the box the craftsmanship is just so-so. I'm not sure if they are worth $74.00 (which is what I paid) they look like they are made of leather and wood. Though the quality isn't nearly as nice. But if you don't care if you have real Jacks, then buy these. I'm just shallow enough to care ;)",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"These shoes are fake! After being skeptical from reading the already not so great reviews, I did my research as soon as I received them. Naturally, they said ""Made in Dominican Republic"" and the size was hand written on them in pen, which I was afraid of. Right away, I emailed the Jack Rogers company (not Amazon dealer) and asked what they thought. They said ""this is how we make our shoes AS OF NOW"", which they are basically saying they are outsourcing and using cheaper materials behind the backs of their customers who still believe they are ""Jack Rogers USA"" ... how can you call yourself that if your shoes are blatantly stamped with something contradicting that? Either Jack Rogers thinks we are stupid, or they are.  ALSO, my friend bought a pair of ""authentic"" Jack Rogers from Dillards for $130. I saw them and they were so obviously fake, had ""Made in Dominican Republic"" stamped on them, and were RIPPING 3 months after she purchased them. Jack Rogers is scamming us. They think they can change their whole production process behind our backs without us finding out. I hope they get caught before many more people waste their hard earned money thinking they are buying high quality shoes from a ""reliable"" company.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"UPDATE 3/13/18: Updating my review as I said I would should the condition of the shoes rapidly decline. I've worn these sneakers almost daily but mostly just to the office, not at all running around fields or city streets etc, and approximately 2 months in the white siding of the sneaker that attaches to the leather upper is separating in a few parts (on one of the sneakers the siding started to separate after basically 1 month). Mind you, this occurred with my old Cons as well, but not 2 months in. I'm pretty sure at this point that these are fake or just shoddier than usual construction. Otherwise the shoes are fine. Nothing else is wrong. But this is concerning in and of itself.First off, I appreciate super fast shipping. I expected these about a week after ordering, but they arrived about 24 hours later. Awesome!Now, to the sneaker itself. I bought these to replace the same sneakers , also purchased on amazon but from a different seller, from 1 1/2 years ago. Upon opening the box and picking up these new sneakers I could tell there were some small changes. Now, does this mean they are fake, or does converse make small changes to the shoe year to year? Im honestly unsure. But the changes I noticed included these new sneakers being much lighter, I can hold the old pair in one hand and the new pair in another and easily feel the difference in weight. The old pair also have the shoe size imprinted on the bottom of the sole, the new pair do not. And the old pair has slightly different font on the tag on the tongue. Also, the boxes ( I still have my old shoe box) are the same except for some slightly different wording on the sticker. So again, are these fake or is there a slight difference year to year or factory to factory? Im unsure. But otherwise, these sneakers seem good. Per usual with converse they run about half a size large, so you might want to order half a size small. I plan on keeping these because the price was good and they still look and feel pretty good, but if they suddenly and quickly fall apart Ill report it.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Jean-Pierre and I LOVE to have our monthly Redneck Night.  We put on our tight jeans, our silver-tipped cowboy boots, and our big David Allan Coe hats.

We strut our stuff into the Bubba Room and watch our favorite redneck movies:  usually Roadhouse or Brokeback Mountain.

"I'm bummed that these are without a doubt fake, sold by PrimeDeals Online. They are good fakes, but that's not what you're paying for! Right out of the box, the fit was off, the lens sticker was one I hadn't seen before, and the case was different than normal. I decided to compare it to my real folding wayfarers as these were a my 2nd pair (and in a diff color). The insignia on both sides doesn't match up, along with the color and quality of printing. The font on the interior left is different, the ""RB4105"" is way too far down on the end, and the quality and color of printing doesn't match my pair or even what's printed on the right hand side. On the right, the printing is much fainter and doesn't match the font size of the real ones. The quality of the plastic frame is different and it doesn't sit perfectly flush unfolded in the front hinge area unless I force it into that position. Last but not least, the cleaning cloth was loose in the box (tell-tale sign), the box was beat up, and the ray ban pamphlet was shoved in there. Also the ""ray ban"" on the sides isn't as raised as it should be. Also, the small black case should say ""folding wayfarer"" and is a much softer material than the case I received.If you've purchased these, I'm sorry!

"I purchased this product to use on two watches: a possibly fake Swiss Army watch, and a genuine Casio digital runner's watch.  I had no problem with the span of the wrench that some people have written about.  However, the product arrived in a box that looked used.  The number of bits was off - for some reason, someone had included a little plastic bag with three additional bits.  No idea why or how they might relate to a watch.  There are no instructions in the box, but the box does say, and I quote: ""12pc (4 of 3) Screw-On Pins"".  As I mentioned, someone had slipped in an additional 3 pins, so I had a potential 15 pins.  However, none of them contained threads, nor did the sockets that they were to fit into.  So how these might be ""screw-on"" eludes me.  In fact, the sockets are larger than the bit diameters, and with no threads or anything to hold them in place, they fall out.  Now the photo shows the wrench placed onto the watch from the top, so in this position, there is no way that the bits would not fall out of the sockets.  What gives?  Classic Chinese marketing, where claims are made but they border on outright lies? Or just really bad quality control?  I vote for the latter.  You can see evidence of incompetence in the packaging:  it says that it is a two-pin opener, but the picture shows an obvious three-pin device.The cost of returning the item, as I would have to pay postage, wasn't worth it, so I improvised.  I found some old putty and used it to seat the bits into the sockets so that I could turn the device such that the bits were hanging downwards.  With some adjustments, I was able to open the watch backs and replace the batteries.  Since both these watches are supposed to be waterproof to 100 m, I am wondering whether I was able to screw the backs on well enough to make them watertight, as the buts wobbled quite a bit.  I'll find out I guess the hard way if I failed.Overall, this device sucks big time, and I would highly recommend no one ever purchase this product, and that Amazon ban it from sale.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"This is probably the worst tool I have ever purchased! At first glance out of the box I though it was pretty good but not for long. It comes with many little tips that you plug into the tool to fit the notches in the back plate of your watch. The inside of the fake wood box (No big deal) has a custom foam bottom with a cutout matching the shape of the tool and a bunch of holes were the tips were supposed to be inserted. The foam is very weak and it did not hold the tips in place during shipping. Again, you would think no big deal but what happened is that some of the tips (three or four) got jammed in between the two metal plates of the tool and I had to get another tool to pry them out. The tips should be in a little plastic bag when shipped and then you can store them in the foam storage holes. OK your probably thinking is this guy nuts? Well last but not least, two of the the three sockets that the tips are supposed to plug into, had little round retaining springs in them to hold the tips in firmly, one did not have the spring. All of the tips fit into the one that didn't have the retainer spring but have a very loose fit and can fall out. The tips do not plug into the other two sockets that have the retainer springs AT ALL! Some of the tips are poorly finished with metal flashing that has to be ground off. The tool is not usable as is. I can probably modify it and get it to work. The design of the tool is fine. There are two adjustments for the tip spacing and the tool itself seems to be made with strong metal parts. I would much prefer to pay more for a tool not made in China that was made with quality and that you could use out of the box without repairing or having to modify it. This could have been a fluke so if you can't find a better one you could take a chance on it because it's so cheap. It's so cheap that it's not worth the trouble to return it.

We returned this pair and ordered the next size down. Again they just weren't quite right. They were very narrow.

"The canvas fabric of these shoes was considerably stiffer than the Toms I've bought at Nordstrom. After wearing them for less than an hour I got blisters on my feet which have never happened with other authentic Toms. I got suspicious and inspected the shoes - they looked off.  The fabric, the stitching, and the font inside the shoe.  I did a side-by-side of Tom's I purchased from Nordstrom and it just didn't look right. I went online and read all of the reviews and realized I'm not the only one and this seller has been sending fakes to other customers. I would not recommend purchasing these - go to an official retailer. I have completely wasted my money on these and the retailer will not refund my money. They only told me that their shoes are authentic. But all of these customers who have posted reviews are proof.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"I was skeptical to order because of reviews claiming these Toms were fake, but I ordered anyway. When I first received them, I couldn't find any reason to believe they weren't authentic. HOWEVER, when I tried them on in my apartment I found them to be very slippery. The soles have almost no traction, and look very different than my other pair of AUTHENTIC Toms. So, I ordered the same style from the Toms website and compared the two shoes side-by-side to make sure. The bottoms are COMPLETELY different. This may be the only indication that they're fake Toms, but it's a big difference. After all, what good is a shoe if it's so slippery you can barely walk? DO NOT ORDER!

"This was my first pair of Tom's, so I wasn't entirely sure what size to order, so I relied on some reviews.. I typically wear a 9-9.5, so I ordered a 9.5 because some reviews had said that it was necessary to go on the larger side with this particular shoe. They were WAY too big, unwearable, as my feet did not even stay in them when I walked. Ok, no problem, I'll return them and get a 9. Well I read some more reviews afterwards claiming that shoes from this seller are fake. I went to go take a closer look at mine and realized they are a 9.5W... Not only did I not order a wide, according to the Tom's website the company doesn't even sell shoes in wide, only medium. So glad I checked, as I was about to go ahead and just order the 9's. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything from this seller and will definitely go directly through Tom's. Lesson learned.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

read all the nasty reviews. still i went ahead to buy  for the sake of curiosity.undeniably i loved and respected the brand.i can accept and understand how they  made it lighter/thinner this time....but what's disturbing with the Levi's i got are the craftsmanship....how the stitches were. 2 major horrible things I sadly noticed...1.) the stiches along side the pants( the entire length of the thigh area ...which is the outer side of the pants...the stitches were horribly loose.i have to take it to a tailor the next day to have it reinforced. my girlfriend keep telling me maybe It was a fake...but i am convinced with amazon's items.i mean if it's sold by them.i trusted Amazon. i still feel they're not knockoffs even though they scream of being one. 2.) i don't know the technical name...or what to call it. the bottom edge of the pants. my old levi's and even the photos on amazon....showed a somewhat right amount of fold.(am talking about the very bottom edge of the pants where it touches your feet) the folds on the Levi's that i got are so crazy thin.its about a quarter of an inch...as opposed to maybe half an inch...if we base on the photos and the old levi's that i have. this is when i started to feel cheated.the loose stitches i blame on the quality control or maybe the guy in Haiti who did the pants had a bad day. but the bottom fold is really disappointing and its not the same as shown in the pictures. To say the least this is were Amazon should be responsible enough to set buyer's expectations based on the photos they show.,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

It was a real disappointment.The reason I wanted to purchase another Skagen watch when my band broke on my other watch, is that I liked the look. Unfortunately, I was told by several jewelers whom I asked about fixing the watch that it would cost me about the price of a new one to fix the old b/c Skagen sold the company and the new owners have TERRIBLE customer service.In short, this watch is not what I had hoped for.  There is nothing unique or interesting about it.  The key feature, for me, that commends the Skagen brand is its thin, sleek casing.  Clearly that is no longer the case, at least not with this particular model.  Not sure if they no longer manufacture that line anymore.  But absent the sleek look, I will select another brand and one that I know I can service without hassle.  I was willing to take the risk with Skagen, but now after seeing the watch I don't want to go this route and will select another brand that appeals to me, and one whose manufacturer stands 100% behind their brand and their product.

"What a cute costume!  My granddaughter LOVES Jessie and was so excited to receive the costume for her (4th) birthday!  Unfortunately it did NOT come with the hat (as ordered) AND the both the fabric (sleazy) and the workmanship were poor!  It's a good thing I can sew becaue I had to reconstruct (yes, ""reconstruct"" - not simply mend!) the entire costume!  The seam of one sleeve was frayed open from underarm to cuff; the other from midsleeve up and then down the side to the waist.  One cuff was open by about an inch; the other attached only by about half an inch!  It was most disappointing!  We would have been willing to pay a little more for something that was actually well-made and could be enjoyed!
