Seller Issue These are fakes. I thought they felt weird and they don't have the RB on the nose piece like my other RayBans have. They feel shoddy too.,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue This is definitely a scam. Very very very very good fakes. I paid attention to every little detail and it even fooled some people that work at a sunglass store. But I got a second and third opinion and they were surprised by what good of fakes these were. First of all the clear coat over the back of the arms that rests on your ears is a different shape from the real Ray-Bans. Look it up online to identify what I am talking about. The plastic part goes out to the right a little too much. Also, the etched RB that this company claims to have on the sunglasses is not etched correctly. Go to any store and compare them and you will see that the RB is eched on the inside of the lens not on the outside of the lens. You shouldn't even be able to feel it if they are real. We paid close attention to the shade of the blue and it is different from the real RayBans. The gold frame is lighter than the real pair and the writing on the side should have a space between the RB and the 3025. It should not read RB3025 which this fake pair does. Real Ray Bans have a different font and are more legible because it is written bigger and the code should read RB 3025 with a SPACE between. Very minor things to look out for. Don't let them get passed you. Pay close attention to the details because they're very hard to notice. They really have a lot of people fooled. The employees and I dissected these sunglasses and the shape of the lens is also very slightly different. Also, in department stores like Nordstrom and all the other places that sell the real product you shouldn't receive a fake tag. Normally it just comes in the box and the box has a bar code label attached on the side of the silver RayBan box. On this package, it is sealed very well on bubble wrap and labeled with a bar code over the bubble wrap instead and the label is most definitely not made by RayBan. Just so everyone is aware you can pay a small fee to get those made to make your business look legitimate. Also, they're so slick that they also customized a sticker to fake their authenticity because things like that fool a lot of people. The sticker reads that if the box or sticker appears unopened, it is because the package was opened during shipment. Trying, of course, to impersonate a legitimate and trustworthy business and trying make it seem like they're looking out, but really if they were then they would have delivered the real deal. This is not a reliable company at all and it's actually a huge deal because they are claiming to be something they are not. Last but not least, the one thing that got me up to go check a second and third time is on the clear part that sits over the nose the RB logo is not supposed to be the same on both nose pieces. One is supposed to be upside down and the other is supposed to sit forward so that it is legible. It's just something that you have to pay attention to because RayBans rarely have manufacture issues. These are definitely definitely definitely fake. Very good ones. But still fake. Stay far away from these sellers. They're nothing but a scam. Wonder if they know it's illegal? ? ?",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"Seller Issue Watch out, these are very clever fakes. They got me, don't let them get you too. If you go ahead and buy them anyways. Flick an authentic pair of Ray-Ban lens with your fingernail and listen to the sound. Then flick these lens and listen. You'll notice a distinct difference. I have 5 pairs of Ray-Bans I bought from ray-ban.com and they all have the same sound. The 2 pairs I bought from Hong Kong sound the same as each other, but different than the other 5 pairs I have. It's because they use a low quality lens and the color wears off. Please don't buy and support scammers.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue Authentic or fake, I don't know; but I can definitely say the New Wayfarers I bought from Sunglass Express are of lower quality than the pair I bought in 2011.Yes, the frames squeak and creak. Even though polarized, the light green G-15 lenses offer little protection from the sunshine. I found myself squinting through my $120 Ray-Bans. That's bogus. I was almost tempted to pop out the lenses and make sure they weren't polycarbonate plastic instead of the crystal green (glass) lenses I had been promised.Strangely enough, the RB2132 Ray-Ban New Wayfarer I bought from Sunglass Express is almost a carbon-copy of the $39.99 Kirkland Abruzzo frame offered by Costco. The only difference between the two is that the Ray-Ban front is flat across, and the bridge of the Kirkland frame is raised.I returned my RB2132s to Sunglass Express.

"Seller Issue I have worn Danskos for 13 years and for all of that time I've been a size 38. When these shoes came I was so excited, they are so cute, but they are about 4/5 the width of my foot. I could barely get them on, but I really wanted them so I tried walking up and down my hall. The top of the boot pressed down on the top of my shoe and I have no arches (I have flat feet). My husband suggested they would stretch out, but after 5 minutes my feet were throbbing and I had to take them off fast. Throbbing feet from 5 minutes is not what I know Danskos to be. My experience of a Dansko is that I put them on, even brand new, and my feet rejoice. These shoes are impostors. Beautiful, but fake. I hope this is a fluke and not a Dansko trend of giving up comfort for style.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

When he stated the differences between a real one & a fake one and I hate fake ones at any cost but he did show a flaw in the design of this particular model here and I did some of my own research and found out that he was 100% correct. This Michael Kors watch is a knock off (Fake) or what we say in Brooklyn a Fugayzie... I would love to buy the real one on Amazon but feeling kind of leiry after this close call.

Seller Issue Not sure if these boots are REAL EMU's. The insole does not come out like they do in real UGGS and I thought real EMU's were made in Australia but there was a Made IN CHINA label stitched in the inside of the boot. I need them for a ski trip so won't send them back yet. I'll see how they hold out for the next few weeks but I am pretty sure these are counterfeit or EMU is of lesser quality than I expected and I will go back to MADE IN AUSTRALIA UGGs.

"Seller Issue I bought these Emu's after a lot of research. Was very excited to receive them but very disappointed when I realized what I was sent looked like fake Emu's. They didn't match the photos online at all.1) The heel product label should be brown leather with special stitching. This was not the case with mine. It looked like a rubber emblem.2) The stitching was uneven at the top of the boot. This should never happen with any top-quality boot.3) According to the emuaustralia.com website, the insole should be removeable for the Stinger low boot. It should also have a molded heel. Mine did not.4) There was no Emu fold-over label at the very top of the boot, which is typical of this brand.So, sadly, my boots appear to be fake & I've notified Emu Australia directly that these were sold to me by this particular company (Fusion Apparel).Beware when purchasing.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"Seller Issue One of the posts came bent. It was easy enough to straighten with a pair of pliers, but there's no reason it should have been bent with the way it was packaged.The posts are also way too long. They touch my neck, and if anything touches my earlobe, they stab into me.And the jewelry looks gaudy. If you have small earlobes like me, they dwarf them. The stones look like fake, cloudy plastic in any sort of light. I've had another pair of cz earrings that sparkled and were clear, so I'm certain this is not how all fake diamonds look.I'm chalking it up to wasting money on the hit and miss of ordering online, but I'm very disappointed that these were as terrible as they are with how good the reviews were. I'd planned to order two more sets from this same brand, but am now skeptical that all their product is as low-quality as this pair turned out to be.EDIT: I'm bumping the review down to one star. I wore these for a bit and really tried to like them, but it turns out I'm allergic to whatever metal this is. I'm not allergic to silver.

"Product Issue These vests look great online and ok in person. If you're only going to use them once, they're OK I guess and will help you fake it temporarily. Be aware, they are supposedly 100% polyester as the ad specifies the tie and vests are made of the same material. I'm not sure if that's correct, perhaps the back of the vest is polyester. The front feels like plastic and wearing these vests feels like wearing a tarp. It's not even what I would consider real cloth. It has the consistency of those one-time-use plastic table covers and is as thin as paper.The ties are ok. They're not silk, they are 100% polyester, but that's ok. The styles are very fashionable and they look good.Overall it's just not for me, the quality of the vest is too poor to keep, and I'm going to try to return it.

For practical purposes, I can bet that only one thick college textbook and a notepad could fit in this thing at one time. The size renders it so absolutely useless that you might as well just carry whatever you were going to put in it in your hands. Not to mention that if you're six foot tall or taller, this bag is gonna look hilarious on you-- like you lifted a backpack from a kindergarten cubby or something.

Checked the tags. Tags were different.. One was imprinted on the canvas, the other, an iron on sticker. After that I did some digging. There were several variances in the two shoes.

I'm a size 7 1/2 in EVERY SINGLE SHOE I OWN. These did not even fit me. I couldn't get them on at all. My other Tom's are the same size and no issues. This leads me to believe that possibly they are fake because usually fake shoes are made in other countries and those sizes run small especially in China.

"Seller Issue I usually do not write negative reviews since I'm a long-time happy Amazon customer. I ordered a size 8 pair of black Toms sold by DirectExpress and fulfilled by Amazon. I am not sure whether the pair I received are fake Toms or if they're defective, but these were far TOO narrow, extremely stiff even though they're supposed to be made of canvas material, and way too small lengthwise. I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe halfway, and neither could my sister or my mom, who both have smaller feet (they're size 6 and 7). The reason I ordered a pair of Toms from Amazon is because I already own a black pair in size 8 that I bought in-store which I find ridiculously comfortable and they're my favorite pair of shoes (keeping in mind I do have wider feet and don't have the easiest time finding the right shoes), but they were falling apart so I wanted to order a replacement. Bad idea...I have to return these. I'm not really sure what went wrong but I'm disappointed and now I need to go through the process of returning them AND making the trip to the store to buy an authentic pair and pay more for it---but I would gladly pay more for authentic quality at this point.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

The real ones I got were from Shoeamerica.That said, I still don't know which size is right for me, I normally wear a 7, but the real 7's are too small.

"Seller Issue From your page:Levi's Men's 505 Straight (Regular) Fit JeanThese are not the same thing, nor are they the same jeans. Regular Fit 505 jeans were discontinued by Levi's. Their replacement is the Straight Fit, which among other things, has less belt loops and doesn't seem to fit worth a damn. Please, Amazon, at least fix the wording, there is no such thing as 505 Straight (Regular) Fit Levi's.I would gladly buy 2 pair of regular fit 505s right now, but there aren't any, so I had to buy a used pair off of ebay.After that wears out, I guess I'll go naked. I'll never buy what they are currently selling. Some things should nto be messed with. Levi's 505 regular fit jeans were great the way they were.**UPDATE** 27 June 2013Upon checking the Levi's website recently, I saw most wanted items one of which was 505 regular fit. So I click on it, and there are all the same pictures as when they were selling 505 straight jeans. So I contacted customer support:ME:So, last year I got what may be one of the last pairs of 505 regular fit jeans I'll ever buy, because you decided to discontinue them in favor 505 straight whatever hell that is. Now your site states that again sell 505 regular fit jeans yet the pictures all show the 505 straight (as noted by only having 5 belt loops...), so which is it? Are you truly selling REAL 505 regular fit jeans again, or are pulling a fast one on everyone and selling the straight crap as regular fit? I swear you will never get another dime from me or my family until you bring back original '60s through 2011/2012 era 505 regular fit jeans. (plain old dark blue denim new looking jeans. I don't need 40 different colors or holes in the knee from the factory. I don't need them to look like they've been worn in, I'll do that on my own. I'll go naked or wear shorts and sweats to work if I have to, before I ever buy anything else you make. Please tell me your selling the real deal again.Received from LEVI'S 17 Jun 2013:Diana here from Levi Strauss & Co. Thanks for contacting us.Levi's 505 are still a straight fit with a straight leg opening.

I doubt it will do any good, but this is just a bunch of BS!!!!!!**Update** Febraury 2015So, now the Levi's web site for any 505 regualr fit says sits at waist and when I looked at some in a local store, the tag says sits at waist. Unfortuantely, there are still only 5 belt loops, inconsistant material, different colors of thread bewteen the outside pocket stiching and the across-the- pocket stiching (was yallow isntead of gold/orange) and in some cases, tiny shallow front pockets.It appears they have changed only enough of the details back to avoid a law suit, but the jeans are still not what we all want.

"Seller Issue I ordered three pairs of jeans and two of them are most likely not real Levis. The thread color on the pockets was a almost neon green color. I'm use to seeing the same orange stitching throughout the entire pant. The Levis patch on the back looks fake. The zipper is very different! The actual tab you use to zip and unzip is very distinctive on real Levis. They have a raised notch stamped into them and the Levis logo engraved into the tiny tab. The ones I got were just a flat copper tab, no notch, no logo. And the biggest giveaway, the fit! I'm use to my 550's fitting loose but comfortable but these fakers were tight around the leg and fit terrible around the waist. Like I said, one pair was the real deal and I was able to compare them side by side. Unfortunately, I noticed these things when I first put them on...after I had washed them like I do with all of my clothes. So of course I could not return them.

"Seller Issue I am always puzzled at the fan service paid to Oakley; they charge a very high amount for their products, which in the experience of this buyer, either don't do what they are advertised to do, or break after less than one year.  And, seeing as how Oakley PRIDES themselves on being the top choice for athletes and ""Special Forces around the world"", I'm not sure how they keep getting away with it.  Prestige is a powerful thing, I suppose.First off - comfort.  These boots are comfortable, for the first two weeks.  After that, the inner lining of the boot, which is nothing more than upholstered padding, is worn off by contact with the foot.  And this was just from me walking around campus.Second - the fit.  I ordered a size down, and there was still nearly two inches of space for my foot to slide around in.Third - the ""waterproofing"".  Don't be fooled, ""waterproof"" material and ""seam-sealed"" construction will give you a waterproof boot; unfortunately, these boots are lacking the latter.  So, the waterproof material of the boot beads and channels water into the seam of the tongue that is not sealed, and places it directly on your foot.  I stepped in water 3-4"" deep, and it ran into the shoe like I was wearing a pair of crocs.  I find it weird that none of the other reviewers mention this, but they are probably still too busy staring at the ""O"" symbol to ever fathom that something could be wrong.Finally - The price.  I don't really need to extrapolate, if you are going to sell something for this much money, it better perform.  I highly doubt SF teams are deploying wearing these, and if they are, they are having to buy new boots after each rotation, and wrap them in duct tape when encountering water over 10 mm high.Seriously, go buy some Danners or Timberlands, and get what you pay for, instead of feeding the money machine that is Oakley.",Product Authenticity Issue,Delivery and Return Issue

I did read some reviews saying the case did not fit this season's large sunglasses. Mine are moderate in size.When the case arrived  I was impressed by its thick leather and spring-loaded closing. The red was a good color. Once I tried to put my sunglasses in, things became very frustrating. Because the leather is robust, I have been able to stretch it to make the case useable while I find another case that can actually fit my sunglasses.I do recommend it for regular glasses.",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue
"Product Issue Having worn Lee relaxed fit jeans for many years, I am very disappointed in this model. There's too much spandex and the fabric feels thin and lightweight. The waist is oversized and the thighs are definitely not ""relaxed"", so any bending of the knees results in the jeans sliding downward. The product descriptions aren't very helpful, as the different colors actually have different amounts of cotton/spandex. I've found the fit varies by the content, so I'll have to keep ordering by trial and error to find a pair that fits me. I've heard that Lee has corrected some of the fit problems and I suspect that there are still a lot of the older jeans in the market.",Design Issue,Product Description Issue

These shoes do fit and are comfortable but as they have not even made it through 1 year of use for me I would not recommend these shoes.Update - 6-19-2017  The shoes I bought last year had a seam on the inside of the foot lower piece of leather.  Unfortunately the product description on this site shows that seam does not exist in the pictures.  I ordered the shoes again hoping the Amazon site was correct with the pictures but it is not.

"Product Issue Well gee, I guess I'm not a Genius, Artist, or an Innovator (or a ""G.A.I."" as stated in the oh-so-""clever"" and not at all condescending product description) as the ViewSlimmy wallet was completely useless to me for day to day activities.  I take it that G.A.I.s don't have a need for such bourgeois items as an auto-club card, driver's license, health insurance card, security card/badge, library card (I guess G.A.I.s don't read), etc.Long story short: I wanted a wallet with an external ID window so I could easily display and access my security ID without removing it from my wallet.  I don't like wearing my ID around my neck or dangling from my wrist; but I need it on me at all times in my high security work environment. I bought this wallet with high expectations, but immediately had to return it as it would not hold even half of the items I need on a day to day basis.  Also, and perhaps more importantly, while the materials were good I found the stitching/construction to be sub-standard at best.So, all you G.A.I.s that fall for condescending sales pitches and don't need to carry much in your wallets (assuming you can scrape together the cash as this wallet is WAY overpriced), you will be very happy with this product.

The ""white smooth"" in the pictures is essentially the exact shoe that I would like to have and to wear. Unfortunately, it does not look like the picture. The tongue of the shoe is a weird light green/off-blue. It almost looks as if you have worn new blue jeans, and accidentally stained the tongue. But that's what this shoe looks like new.

"Product Issue This bra was a huge disappointment. Amazon's return service was just the moldy cherry on my rancid lingerie shopping experience.To be fair, I have been a customer of Amazon's for years, starting back when they only sold books. I jumped on the Prime membership right away and haven't let the membership expire since. Amazon normally provides great service, which is why I was so shocked by the poor response to my refund request here. The bra itself seemed oddly shaped, as if the cups had boning in them or something. And I don't mean around the edges, where an underwire would run, I mean straight through the center of the cup. I can't imagine that being very flattering. Not only that, but the size of the cups appeared to be much smaller compared to other strapless bras I own of the same size. I thought that perhaps I had received a defective bra... I couldn't imagine that it was supposed to look the way it did. (The cup itself was a different fabric on the inside than the rest of the torso- this is mainly what made me suspect a defect. But who knows, maybe they MEANT to give ladies trapezoid boobs.)No problem, I just returned the bra. After all, as you can see in the product description, Amazon claims that this product is available for FREE returns if we are dissatisfied. APPARENTLY, free returns mean that they charge you for shipping, and they only refund less than a third of the price.

"Product Issue If you're wondering whether or not you want to be a death eater for Halloween, read this breakdown and you can decide for yourself if its for you!First things first, the shipping. It was 2 day shipping for me, and I actually ended up getting it the next day, chalk one up for UPS!Second, the packaging. Now this isn't the most durable costume in the world, but there was plenty of airbags and everythingseemed to be well placed, the ONLY thing I could find wrong with the way it was packaged was that there was a SLIGHT dent in the mask, but since its really thin i kind of expected it to be flattened, which it was not, Way to go guys.Third, the costume itself. You get what is says really, a hooded robe with a separate, (but attachable via included strings) hood. Personally I like that its not sewed on there so I have the option, but that's up to you. The holes in the arms ARE intentional, they're put there so that you can wear the sleeves like a glove (just like the picture shows). The only odd thing I saw was that the collar appeared to face the direction in which wearing it right would leave the opening by the legs on my backside,though I just opened it so maybe i put it on backwards or something. I might just make a cut along the fabric so there's an opening on both sides, it just seems cooler and more comfortable to me. The mask is kind of cheap, but its not going to easily rip as long as you're gentle with it. Obviously you're going to need a wand, but that's sold separately (just in case you didn't read the product description).And to top it off, it even came in a resealable bag with an attached coat hanger, so when you're done with it you can hang it up for next year, or for someone else to use! Have fun and go kill some muggles!EDIT(11/1/11)I must have been handling this costume way too carefully when I took it out of the box. While all of what I said above is still true, the costume was made without any concern to quality. While walking, this thing was constantly ripping, and by the end of the night was no longer usable. Would I still recommend it? Sure, if you have someone willing to sew it for you like I did, but not for the price its asking. Lower it by about 20 bucks, and THEN you're asking a fair price for the amount of work you put into the material and construction (it honestly felt like they used the cheapest quality, thinnest fabric they could find) that you put into this thing.

If so, then the product description should be changed to a 'Pepsi-Cola Junior's 1970 Vintage T-Shirt'!  Needless to say, I am not wasting any more points on apparel and am sticking with videos where size it not an issue.",Design Issue,Product Description Issue

Hope everyone knows that sunglasses without UV protection are bad for the eyes, since the shades will dialate/open up your pupils and allow more UV into your eyes unprotected.

But I give 2 stars to the seller for not placing a warning on their product description about UV protection - not that I didn't know when purchasing.In summary, if you want something to protect your eyes, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

"Product Issue I bought 4 pairs of these pants. Loved 3. 1 of them, Olson A Pinstripe/Faded Navy, 32x32, was terrible. Though the product description says ""wrinkle resistant,"" the pair in this color was made of a strange ""dry"" fabric that is 60% cotton and 40% polyester (my other pairs are 100% cotton). The fabric is very rigid (reminds me of wearing a tyvek suit), but more importantly the pants are almost permanently wrinkled. Whereas the 100% cotton ones come out nearly flat right out of the dryer, I have only been able to get these somewhat flat (though still creased around the hems) with 20 minutes of ironing by my visiting mother. The production description is very poor for this item since all of the pants say ""22% polyester /78% cotton"" though there are apparently large variations in the fabric. I didn't wear these pants until after 30 days after purchase so didn't notice the difference, so am unable to return these wrinkled pair that sits unused in the bottom of my dresser.",Quality Issue,Product Description Issue

"Product Issue Wow. I just got this item in the mail today and I'm not only disappointed, I'm pretty mad. My shirt does NOT look like the image on the product description page. Yes, it's navy blue. Yes, it has the image of Spider-man on it. However, the image only covers two-thirds of the front of the shirt - not the whole front. If that was the only issue, I would have just been disappointed. However, the fact that it WAS NOT CENTERED on the shirt just makes me mad! The image was applied so that it begins about seven inches down from the shirt collar and extends to the bottom hem. Why do I want seven inches of blank navy cloth at the top? Ridiculous! And it isn't centered along the horizontal axis, either! There's about a two inch margin to the sleeve on one side and a four inch margin to the sleeve on the other! Who applied this image, a six-year old? I just can't see any excuse for this. I am going to contact the seller and ask about a replacement. When I hear back from them (or not), my review will either be dramatically improved or even more harshly critical. Right now, I can only strongly warn people against purchasing this product, or, more specifically, ANYTHING from this seller! One of the few products I have rated as a one-star item...***Review Update as of 10/11/14***I returned the defective shirt via amazon's product return system, and this was free of charge. Yes! I thank-you for the easy return, amazon! I dropped off the box I was returning the shirt in to the local UPS store and received confirmation of the return the same day. Again, thanks to amazon for this simple return procedure/policy. Two days after I notified amazon that the product I received was defective, I received my replacement shirt. (I could have opted for a reversal of charge on the product price or for a product replacement, and I chose the replacement option.) Again, I thank amazon for the quick shipping of the replacement item! Five stars to amazon across the board for the entire return and replacement process!Now for the bad news. The new shirt I received had (for the second time) the screen print off-center. It wasn't as bad as the first time. The first time the centering was absolutely horrible. This time it was just poor. This time the image was affixed several inches higher (maybe about three inches from the shirt collar). The image still rand down below the bottom edge of the shirt, though. To be done correctly, the image would really need to start about ONE INCH from the collar, so it was still lower than it should have been. The horizontal centering was just as bad as before. The image is heavily shifted to the right side of the shirt and I find myself wanting to tug it to the left so that it is centered on my chest. This obviously does not work, so I am still disappointed in the overall quality of the shirt. If all of these shirts have print defects, the price on them should be $5.00 or less. This is a crying shame, as the image is just really, really cool, and the glow-in-the-dark effects are just icing on the cake. Printing the shirt off-center like this is just a travesty. So, I am going to upgrade my rating from a single star to two stars, but that's the best it's getting from me. People really need to know that these shirts are poorly produced before they spend their money on them. I know I wish I would have known this before I had gone ahead with this purchase. I would have picked a different shirt than this one if I had known about the print defects.One last thing that should be made clear: This shirt DOES glow in the dark! I saw one reviewer stating that it doesn't glow, and I don't know why he would make a false statement like that, but IT DOES GLOW! Maybe he doesn't know how to activate a shirt like this? It's not like this shirt uses batteries, of course. The phosphorescent portions of the shirt are light activated! That means that you need to have the printed image of this shirt in contact with light (the brighter and more natural the better) to ""excite"" the phosphorescent parts (in this case, the white portions) of the shirt. Once the shirt is ""charged up,"" you can enter a darkened area and see the luminous white parts glowing in the dark. The effect will fade out after a while. It may glow for twenty minutes or so, but it WILL NOT glow all night or hour after hour. If you want a shirt that ""lights up"" all night, buy a different shirt than this one!!!",Design Issue,Product Description Issue

"Product Issue Boots arrived exactly on time, as predicted. The product appeared top shelf, although these things are STIFF. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity, yet, to feel them on my feet. I spent a great deal of time reading reviews for this product and, noting the comment in the product description--that many purchasers go down a 1/2 size--I ordered the 8.5 rather than the 9. A 9 is my size in everything...other boots, running shoes, etc. I have a completely normal size 9 foot. I could not fit my foot into the 8.5 in this boot. My advice would be to order your normal size, and disregard the tales of how big these run. BTW, I'd disregard the suggestions that you go to a store and try them on ""first,"" before ordering from Amazon. That is a sin. Amazon has a generous and easy return policy. Don't abuse your local merchants.",Quality Issue,Product Description Issue
"Product Issue This Hanes has FreshIQ, which I don't want and it was not in the product description. I have no idea what freshIQ is. Is fresh IQ a toxic chemical? I don't need freshIQ and I definitely don't want freshIQ and more complicated clothes. I got 3 stripes and they are only 50% cotton. I ordered 6 and got a 7 pack. I refuse to wear these until I find out what freshIQ is, so I can't say for sure on comfort. My old hanes have an elastic waistband that's not totally covered and it chafes when taking off and it's not very comfortable, but I'm desperate, which is why I decided to try hanes again. The underwear market is terrible, so consider these despite my negative review. Fruit of the loom also fails to completely cover the waistband elastic and also the leg elastics. Old Hanes does cover the leg elastics, but it's very thin in that area. I liked reebok (double layer in front), but the front center vertical seam was irritating a sensitive area, but I still think still reebok might work for some people who are not as sensitive as I am and want 2 layers in the front area, although it took 1 year for reebok to bother me. Jockey elance men's are too small, too tight, and too thin (1 ultra thin layer), but have fully covered elastics, although a bit thin and cheap. Jockey right side seam is thick and irritating. Sadly, all brands have problems. Good luck. Reebok has the best waistband and leg openings even though they have unnecessary front center seams.",Design Issue,Product Description Issue
"Product Issue I read the reviews for this robe and thought I was getting a robe with a fleece lining.  However, upon receiving the item, seeing there was no fleece lining, I rechecked the description for this robe.  It is a robe made of the cheap material used for all Halloween costumes that will last one Halloween.  The ""clasp"" is a mechanism that you have to attach to both sides of the robe that will easily rip the material.  This is not a warm robe to wear on a chilly Halloween night.  That being said, my 8 year old son is thrilled with it because of the emblem and the hood.  It is probably not worth the money I spent on it.

"Product Issue Item arrived sealed in original packaging with no damage.  Upon opening the item itself contained no less then 10 different factory defects that were obviously visible to the exterior and interior of the cabinet.  manufacturing scratches to wood were stained and sealed over and cut cross grain.  Interior velvet not seamed properly, edges show, uneven, and a chunk missing.  Exterior drawers (3) contain pit holes in the wood and are plainly visible.  Ring dividers, one row is half the height of the other 4 rows adjacent-again this isn't damage but cut disproportionately and slapped in.  Very disappointed with the quality of the specific item received.Picture of item looks great & overall design a good idea, BUT the one received wouldn't even make a factory 2nd rating--FACTORY REJECT that they stained and hoped no one would notice.Have contacted the factory per the enclosed Parts and Damage Replacement Procedure - have to see if they stand behind their product.  At this point, wouldn't spend the money, and now there is no gift to surprise my spouse with the birthday.Contacted manufacturer--their reply was that the item was 'antiqued' and that various techniques are used to create a distressed and antiqued product, and that the pit holes in the drawers were intentional.  Unfortunately, no where in the product description was it mentioned that the product was ""Antiqued or Distressed.""  This was the one and only response from the manufacturer.

Don't believe me - see the photo! I checked the visible adhesive plastic tag when I received the order and then put the pants in a drawer until I needed them.

"Product Issue I purchased this for my husband, who is prior military. I cannot describe, nor explain, how excited he was while waiting for this thing to come. Seriously, when the UPS guy pulled in front of the house my hubby ran outside like a school girl. The packaging opening scene that followed was something straight out of Christmas morning with small children. And then came the complaints. The hat is not a Condor hat, really, he made me go look at the condor site, and he is right it is not a Condor hat. The velcro thingies for patches are not the sizes listed in the product description on amazon. Apparently the camo is not genuine multicam, he keeps ranting there's pink in there, I don't know what this means, I just know the camo is not right. He dragged out his camelbac to illustrate the differences, as though I hadn't already gotten the point. Real condor hats are 100 percent cotton this thing isn't, but its product description says it isnt, so I don't know. The hat does seem rather cheaply made. If you are looking for a camo hat maybe this is the one for you. If you are purchasing this for a camo connoisseur or prior military be prepared for their letdown.

"Product Issue Buyer beware is in order, I suppose. It was too good to be true that my size in these boots were on sale and had everything I wanted in a work boot.  Well, I was lied to. The product description clearly stated these boots had Moisture managing mesh linings, which they did not, and did not state that they had a steel toe, which they do. I did not want a steel toe and I was very much interested in the mesh lining, so were it not for the fact that they actually fit very well, and I'm just sick and tired of looking for good-fitting work boots, I would be returning them. So I'm conflicted. They fit well and I don't want to go through the hassle of returning them, but they're not what I ordered, hence the very low rating.

"Seller Issue Not the bag advertised!As many other reviewers have written, I was also seeking the ""Small Classic"" 6x9x17 as advertised.  I paid an extra $150+  to order the bag from The Jungle Store, because they specifically claimed to sell the much sought after Classic Small AmeriBag, 9"" wide.  Nine inches.But it's a fake out.  They shipped the newly designed 11"" wide bag that so many people have complained about. This really bothers me.  The Jungle Store must know that customers want the older, ""classic small bag"", and they used those magic words in their Amazon ad.  They also claimed 6x9x17 in the product description, quite incorrect.But they shipped me the much bigger, heavier, 11"" bag.My sweetie is a small woman who loves her old beat-up Small Classic Nylon AmeriBag.  I wanted to get her an updated beautiful leather replacement. Not to be.I noticed that other sellers had the larger redesigned leather AmeriBag for only $118.00, but they listed the real width of 11"".  So I foolishly bought the bag from The Jungle Store which claimed to have the bag in the more desirable 9"" wide size, paying over $150 more for the size I wanted.  They got my money.  And I do NOT have the bag I expected.As others have noted, this oversized bag is well made, good looking.

My plan was to open one before I would leave work and alternate the warmer between my driving hand and my free hand. I assumed that these would be hotter than putting my hand over the heating vent, but they're not. Maybe a fistful (five or so) of these things would be adequate to warm a cold hand. The packages can be split  to only expose one at a time to air, so that's good.The other problem with these is that they don't give off their maximum level of heat until around an hour after opening, so they're useless for those who would like some spontaneous heat.So...yeah, there is an exothermic reaction going on here, but not anything on the level that the product description would lead one to believe.",Quality Issue,Product Description Issue

"Product Issue When I first put these gloves on I was horrified at how absolutely cheapo they looked. I felt I had been absolutely jipped. There were threads sticking out all over, and there was this horrible white stuffing like thing going on in the gloves that made them absolutely unwearable in public. They weren't even nylon as advertised. In case something changes, this is the copy-paste of the product description.Product DescriptionMade of 100% nylon. One size with botton closure. 9 inches long, 3 inches wide. Thin, soft and stretchable material. Hand Wash Only. Available in white color. Imported  Just like that. Down to the missing period at the end. When I got these gloves they came in dollar-store plastic packaging with the stereotypical cheap-junk, mass-produced, Chinese import cardboard label thing, stapled together to the plastic. Mildly suspicious, I opened the package and checked the glove label. Here is the exact information I saw.ITEM NO.:8108100% POLYESTERONE SIZE FITS MOST.RN# 88490 FUN WORLD DIV.MADE IN SHANG YU ,ZHE JIANG,CHINA11060CGP14MFG.DATE:JAN.-MAR./2011  From what I had seen earlier I wasn't surprised this actually came from China. The material was thin as advertised,but nylon it was not. Maybe they mislabel the amazon ad. The weave seem okay- it didn't seem like it was going to fall apart as soon as I put it on. As for the stretch, they do stretch sideways maybe an Inch and 1/2, but could only get a finger to stretch about a quarter inch longer max. The size was suprisingly nice on my miniature little girl hands (A male I am) but they sure as hell aren't 1 size fits most(Maybe in China it might). On the scale of mens gloves I'd say they're about about an X-SMALL that'll go up to a SMALL or maybe- just maybe- MEDIUM. The fit wasn't what you'd call snug ,at least for me, and the gloves kinda just bunched up and hung there. Maybe if I had buffer hands the fit would be nicer, but it's loose on me. They extend an inch down on the wrist. The material is too thin for the snap closure it comes with and if you're not careful, I think it likely to rip there. The closure is also of an ugly ivory color.  I was disappointed with these gloves. Surely they cost only $5 but damn they weren't even passably wearable in public, like halloween costume gloves. Looking back at these ugly gloves I remembered things can sometimes be fixed to  an extent so I turned them inside out to see if anything could be done. I found that they hadn't been well finished at all and the seams had an enormous excess that had caused that bunching of white stuff inside so I went ahead and cut as much of the excess of as possible without ruining the gloves. 10 or minutes of careful labor won me a better finished pair of gloves that when I put them on, actually were okay. I Still wouldn't wear them in public they're of passable quality for private use.

Here is what the incorrect claim reads on the product description that you should be made aware of:-Waterproof layer prevents leakage-Super absorbent layer absorbs wetnessShe must have had it on for only a few minutes and peed because there was pee all over her and all over my lap.  This diaper looked great and like another reviewer said, ""It seemed to have been made real well""--but it totally did not do what it claimed to do--you'd think if it had super absorbency then it would hold pee for a minute, right?!

"Product Issue Though the description lists the upper part of these sandals as leather, it is decidedly not.  I suspected that was the case when I initially received them in 2010, but I trusted the description and dismissed my concerns.  The fact that these sandals aren't genuine leather might not be a big deal for some.  But now, in 2011, as I'm looking at them wondering if I should take the time to cut the multitude of strings that are coming from each strap or just throw them out, it's a major issue.Because faux leather doesn't wear nearly as well as real leather, I wouldn't have purchased these shoes had I not been misled by the product description.

The Bullet sneaker was listed and said synthetic materials as the description.  I had purchased vegan Bullets in the past so I hoped they were similar.  Unfortunately I could tell once I got them that they were some sort of leather/suede.  I checked the tag inside and it said leather/textile.  I contacted Saucony and they confirmed that it is a leather and textile blend.  It felt like maybe pig skin, (which I have purchased, unknowingly, in the past).I'm sure the shoes are fine for anyone who wears leather, but for anyone looking for synthetic just be aware of materials.As far as Bullet sneaker - if I find the vegan version again I would absolutely buy them again.

Now, all cotton can be considered ""soft"", but in the world of bras (and I have experience) that typically indicates a cup lining that would hide nipple. I definitely did not want or expect it to be ""padded"" as that is something completely different (and I definitely don't need padding at this point), but non-soft cup is also not something that I expected per the product description.If you want a sheer, cotton cheap bra, this is for you.

"Product Issue This is NOT ""full grain, waxed bridle leather"" as STILL shown in the product description. It is ""genuine leather"".You should be able to tell from the Wiki definition that this belt will not last:""The following are not ""true"" organic leathers, but are materials that contain leather fiber. Depending on jurisdiction, they may still be labeled as ""Genuine Leather"", even though the consumer generally can only see the outer layer of the material and can't actually see any of the leather content:Bonded leather or ""Reconstituted leather"" is an economical type that uses leftovers of organic leather (often from leather tanneries or leather workshops) which are shredded and then bonded together with polyurethane binders or latex on top of a fiber sheet. The varying degree of organic leather in the mix (between 10% and 90%) affects the smell and the texture of such product. Due to its reduced cost it is becoming a popular choice for furniture upholstery, especially for commercial use, where durability is needed; however durability can vary widely, depending on the formulation.Bycast leather is a split leather with a layer of polyurethane laminated to the surface and then embossed. Bycast was originally made for the shoe industry and later adopted by the furniture industry. The original formula created by Bayer was strong but expensive. The result is a material that is slightly stiffer but cheaper than top-grain leather but has a much more consistent texture. Because its surface is completely covered in plastic, is easier to clean and maintain, but is not easily repaired.""",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue

It is 8 inches deep, not 5, and it definitely weighs more than 4 pounds.  The tag on the item says that it is 17 X 13 X 8 inches.  I don't have the exact weight, but it feels like more than 5 pounds.  I ordered this because I thought it would be smaller than the Delsey Helium Fusion 3.0, and I like that it has a shoulder strap.  If fact, it is larger than the 3.0.  In addition, it only has a partial zipper opening.  The 3.0 has a full zipper opening. I wish the 3.0 had a shoulder strap, but I still prefer it because it is smaller and more likely to fit under an airline seat, and it opens completely, making packing easier.

"Product Issue I like retro digital watches and even though I have much more expensive watches, I like wearing basic, cheap models. Therefore, I thought this Timex would be a nice addition to my collection. I have some Casio retro digitals and I also have several Timex Ironman models, all of which are nice. But this watch was atrocious. The first thing I noticed removing it from the box was that the LCD display was significantly out of alignment with the case. I guess I'm kind of anal about that, but it immediately made me want to return the watch, on that flaw alone. But there was more. The band was pretty flimsy feeling, unlike the Casio counterpart, which has a much sturdier and nicer looking band. Furthermore, the band was borderline too small. My wrists are medium and this band claimed to be large and should fit with plenty of room, but it didn't. And lastly, the product description claims this model has a chrono, alarm and a timer, but it does not have a timer. At least the version I received did not. Maybe they sent a similar model, but not the exact one. In any case, all these flaws made returning it an easy decision. I'm sticking with the nicer, cheaper and tougher Casio version (Casio Men's A178WA-1A), which is only $13.99. Anyway, maybe the one I got was a factory dud, but bottom line is I'd pass on this one.",Product Description Issue,Product Description Issue

"Seller Issue I wrote a review and my pictures didn't post.. I want people to see the terrible quality of these boots.  The ugg protective spray damaged the boot and the coloring of the suede was rubbing off in HUGE amounts and it stained the boot.  Also the synthetic lining that is fake, it's rough and pulls out and the left boot was tighter than the right boot.  Also the numbers on the box do not match the numbers on the tag inside the boot and there is no hologram.  I am so disappointed, especially with how much I shop with amazon.  I don't mind buying knock offs, but when I'm paying the price for authentic uggs than I expect the quality of authentic uggs.

However after I was questioned, I went back and investigated.  These are very good fakes.  They fit my feet perfectly and hug like a glove.  The key is the security feature that UGG has placed in the boot and on the box.  My reader couldn't pick up the fake code and it didn't contain the holographic image.  Beware of ShoeCentral.

Seller Issue These are definitely NOT the same sambas I purchased 5 years ago. And it's so heart breaking. These shoes (the old style) were TANKS.

Mine are at least 5 years old and I would still wear them except the rubber part on the toe is finally coming apart.THESE.ARE.NOT.THE.SAME.SHOE.AS. BEFORE.Different design. Different shape. Cheaper materials. The bottoms of the new sambas don't even look rubber and they are definitely a different color. They are so squeaky to walk in too. I bought the same exact size as I did in the past and these new ones don't even fit the same. My foot constantly slips out and frankly they just don't look as bad ass as they used to.

"Seller Issue I've worn Rainbow Sandals for years and have always bought them directly from the company web site.

This felt won't last a minute on the hot LA pavement! I am guessing these are (a) defective or (b) fake Rainbows -- unless this felt-looking bottom is a new thing that I'm just not aware of?

Seller Issue These are fake. I bought these to replace my Levi's 527 and they are completely different in quality. The denim on my purchase is thin. The stitching is poor and logos are non existent as pictured. I really do hope that customer will be informed of replica products before purchasing.,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue Purchased a few of these during the Prime Day sale direct from Amazon. I usually try to avoid purchasing name-brand clothing online, but since these were through Amazon and not a third-party seller I was reasonably sure I would be getting a genuine pair of Levi's. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. When compared to a pair I purchased at a department store a few weeks prior, these are clearly of inferior quality and fit.Overall the denim is much rougher than other pairs of Levi's I own. The front pockets are also ridiculously shallow; they can barely fit keys let alone a cell phone. After one wash they shrunk to the point where I could no longer wear them. The department store purchased version has none of these problems.The most obvious suggestion that these are fakes is the zipper. Genuine Levi's have the name stamped on the zipper: these do not. They also have a tag on the inside of the jean with the style number: these do not. Another oddity is a bizarre message written in stilted English on the inside front pocket which tries to convince the wearer that these are genuine Levi's. If the jeans feel the need to preemptively make their case that they aren't fakes, it's not a good sign.Hopefully Amazon will straighten out any issues with their source and either start selling real jeans or discontinue selling the fakes.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"Seller Issue This product was a disappointment for me because it looks obviously fake and you can obviously see that it is plastic.  The arrows are not even long enough, the tips are made of a flimsy foam, and the ends of the arrows are not notched so you can't even pretend to hook them on to the string of the bow ---  so in short, it is not realistic in any way but ok if you are desperate enough to use as a bad prop for Halloween.

My old 10s were a little big and these 10s were too small.  The quality was poor too. The materials weren't as soft or flexible as my originals.

Seller Issue Pretty sure I received a fake pair! When I went on the actual Minnetonka site the soles of the shoes were completely different. No Minnetonka label anywhere and not even made or rubber but a soft squishy foam material. :/,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue Edit: I returned these sandals and ordered directly from the Teva website (where the images still show the older version), and got the same style as what I received on Amazon. This means that the sandal is probably not a fake, and I apologize for making the claim. However, everything negative I have said below is still true. I am very sad to see that the Teva sandal has gone downhill. The quality is now terrible and I will need to be looking for a new favorite summer show.Original Review: The black on black sandal is a knockoff! I have owned this exact brand and style of black/black Teva olawahu sandal in a size 8 for over five years. Three different pairs- all purchased from DSW or online from Teva. I purchased on Amazon because of the cheaper price and Prime shipping. When I received the sandal, the foam part of the sandal is cheaper and not as dense as the genuine Teva sandals. Also, the straps across the top are a tad narrower and are rough and scratchy. They started tearing up the top of my foot within a couple minutes of wearing them. Repeat Teva owners will tell you these sandals do not scratch your feet and are some of the most comfortable sandals in the world. The design is pretty similar to authentic sandals. The only dead giveaway in design that this is a fake product is the different logo insignia where your heel lies and on the outer strap. There should be a rectangular plastic logo. The knockoff has the Teva logo that is just kind of etched into the foam and a fabric logo sewn into the strap. Also, the cheap Foam of the knockoff sandals attracts cat hair and fuzz like no other. My genuine Tevas have never done this. Along the bottom of the sole of each sandal, the middle area seems to be this same material that attracts cat hair. Again, real Teva sandals do not do this. You can see in the photo the differences.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue I am a long time wearer of NB shoes, and they have always fit great.  I was surprised when I put this pair on because the fit was awkward.  The design was also weird, but I just thought that NB was following suit with other companies that were cheapening products to increase profits.  After wearing these shoes out for a day, I knew something was wrong.  They killed my feet, and could not be NB.  Sure enough, I looked the shoes up on the NB website and the picture of the top of the shoes is different from the shoes I received.  Also, the ""N"" on the side of the shoe is raised (it should be flush), and the edges are rough like it was sewn on after the shoe was made.  These are counterfeit shoes.  They don't look or feel like real NB.  Also note:  the product pictures on Amazon show real NB, it was the actual product that was fake.

"Seller Issue I discovered these sunglasses were rip offs when I had to replace one of the lenses after it broke.  After several attempts at fitting them with replacement lenses purchased from sellers on eBay, which were all too small but should have fit based on matching the model number on the temple and purchasing 52mm lenses, I finally took them to an authorized dealer.  He ordered ray ban lenses for the model number on the temple and came up with the same result, lenses that were 52mm, but were too small to fit into these frames.  He showed me that these frames have a different, deeper groove holding the lens, which have been glued in, and confirmed to me that these are fakes.  Who knows if these lenses are UV protected, but they are definitely knock offs.  Buyer beware.  I am contacting Amazon for a refund.  I would never have known these were fakes if I did not try to replace the lenses.  Be aware the lenses look identical to genuine ray ban, down to the script on one lens and ""RB"" inscribed on the other, but the lenses are glued in, and are larger than 52 mm as stated on the temple.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"Seller Issue So, I got this watch as a graduation gift back in March of 2012. It was brand new and I loved it due to the fact that it looked a lot like the Rolex Submariner. Since then it has been my primary watch I wear 24/7. Recently though, (back in June 2013) The wristband broke and Invicta wanted me to pay for shipping AND any parts that they would need to replace. I took it to my local jeweler and they had to reset the band for 10 bucks. While I was there he pointed out what I had always thought was a scratch on the back mineral. He said that it was a hair inside the casing. Now I have owned the watch since it was brand new and NEVER opened the case in its lifetime. He offered to take it out for free but it would destroy the seal for diving. I declined the offer and opted to call Invicta and see what they would do. Once again, they wanted me to send them the watch, pay for shipping, and pay for any repairs that they would do. O, and wait at a minimum of three months to get it back! And this was something that I didn't even do. It was a flaw that happened while it was being made. So I don't think so, I'll save my money for a different watch. The hair hadn't affected watch before, so i left it. Now a month or so later, the bezel fell off the watch. I'm done with Invicta. I really like the watch and it keeps great time, but due to the way it has fallen apart in a year and Invicta's customer service, I think I am going to try a different brand. Maybe Nautica. I've had Timex, Casio and fake Rolexes hold up better than this. So DO NOT BUY!

"Seller Issue When the price looks too good to be true it probably is. Mine were very high quality fakes ordered from the seller ""Sunbathing"" at around half MSRP. I ordered the tortoise frames with green polarized lenses. Everything about them was identical to the real thing except the lens angle was not right. The 2140s should have a drastic angle where the arms meet the front of the frame. Mine had close to a 90 degree angle. I even took them to Sunglass Hut and compared them to the same model 2140, angle was not right at all. However, some people who prefer the straighter angle may be satisfied with these, especially since they are significantly cheaper than retail price. Another giveaway was the printing quality in the booklets they come with. The images were terribly pixelated, looked similar to if I tried to print it on my home printer. They're good quality, but still fake. I'd rather have the real things.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue As soon as I opened the shipping box, I knew that I had received a fake. The ""Ray Ban"" box was bent and dented, and certainly didn't look like it contained a $110 pair of sunglasses. The glasses case was black rather than the brown shown in the picture, and was lined with cheap fuzzy material that left the glasses covered in small black fibers that were very difficult to wipe off. The actual glasses felt sturdy, but the arms were a dead giveaway that these were a knockoff. Not only did they not open evenly (one side opened beyond the width of the front of the frames, while the other stopped at the edge of the front like it's supposed to), but each arm was a different shape! One side was basically straight while the other had a noticeable curve. Needless to say, they did not sit correctly on my face.

"Seller Issue These seem kind of fake to me.  For one, the material is very thin and and loose and they fit very tight on the waist, which most Levis do not.  Also, the only 2 places on the jeans where it says Levis are on the black leather patch on the back (which feels like cardboard to me) and on the front button.  Normally it says Levis all over the jeans.  Another concern is the tags on the inside of the jeans, which are only tags with Chinese writing on them and only say Levis in very small writing on the bottom.  The stitching also seems kind of crappy to me, not like any of the other Levis I own.  The last concern is that on the tab on the back pocket, it just has an R on it, no Levis.

"Seller Issue UPDATE 3/13/18: Updating my review as I said I would should the condition of the shoes rapidly decline. I've worn these sneakers almost daily but mostly just to the office, not at all running around fields or city streets etc, and approximately 2 months in the white siding of the sneaker that attaches to the leather upper is separating in a few parts (on one of the sneakers the siding started to separate after basically 1 month). Mind you, this occurred with my old Cons as well, but not 2 months in. I'm pretty sure at this point that these are fake or just shoddier than usual construction. Otherwise the shoes are fine. Nothing else is wrong. But this is concerning in and of itself.First off, I appreciate super fast shipping. I expected these about a week after ordering, but they arrived about 24 hours later. Awesome!Now, to the sneaker itself. I bought these to replace the same sneakers , also purchased on amazon but from a different seller, from 1 1/2 years ago. Upon opening the box and picking up these new sneakers I could tell there were some small changes. Now, does this mean they are fake, or does converse make small changes to the shoe year to year? Im honestly unsure. But the changes I noticed included these new sneakers being much lighter, I can hold the old pair in one hand and the new pair in another and easily feel the difference in weight. The old pair also have the shoe size imprinted on the bottom of the sole, the new pair do not. And the old pair has slightly different font on the tag on the tongue. Also, the boxes ( I still have my old shoe box) are the same except for some slightly different wording on the sticker. So again, are these fake or is there a slight difference year to year or factory to factory? Im unsure. But otherwise, these sneakers seem good. Per usual with converse they run about half a size large, so you might want to order half a size small. I plan on keeping these because the price was good and they still look and feel pretty good, but if they suddenly and quickly fall apart Ill report it.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

Second i noticed that the small rb engraving on the lens was raised, which means that it was not laser engraved(all authentic ray ban products with an rb etching are laser engraved).

I'm just sad over the dreadful scratches.Just to make sure the wood scratched the Titanium band (and not something else), I dragged the Titanium band over my wooden desk with a slight press to see what would happen. And guess what? More Stratches over the Titanium band.I can't even return this item because of Bodying's first return rule:""1. All returned items must be new and unused, and in unworn condition. All items must be returned with all the original packaging materials. The white security seal must not be broken and must be fully in-tagged with the watch as the same condition as we shipped to you. We're sorry that we are unable to accept any return merchandises without the security seal attached.""In the end, I'm sad over this new watch which I ended paying over $220 for. Not sure if Amazon is writing false details or I was sold a fake watch by Bodying. Something needs to be done for this injustice.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"Seller Issue These Toms seem fake. They have completely fallen apart and faded within the time I've received them. The first day the inside wording came off the sole with wearing them for maybe 30 minutes. Since then, the inside soles have completely popped out. This never happened with my previous pair so this leads me to believe they are fake.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue So these came too small, different sole, different.... everything... yet they looked like Toms. I wondered if they were fakes. But maybe I just had to break them in again? I stared at the box, it looked legit, even though my old ones didn't come in a box (got them at Urban Outfitters). Something was just off, and too much of it. Then I went online and read the reviews... my hunch was right. These are fakes. I don't know how they were able to manipulate their reviews or how they're still on here, but I'm so glad I caught this in time!",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue This was my first pair of Tom's, so I wasn't entirely sure what size to order, so I relied on some reviews.. I typically wear a 9-9.5, so I ordered a 9.5 because some reviews had said that it was necessary to go on the larger side with this particular shoe. They were WAY too big, unwearable, as my feet did not even stay in them when I walked. Ok, no problem, I'll return them and get a 9. Well I read some more reviews afterwards claiming that shoes from this seller are fake. I went to go take a closer look at mine and realized they are a 9.5W... Not only did I not order a wide, according to the Tom's website the company doesn't even sell shoes in wide, only medium. So glad I checked, as I was about to go ahead and just order the 9's. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything from this seller and will definitely go directly through Tom's. Lesson learned.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

"Seller Issue I believe these are also fake Toms albeit really good fakes. I did bring this to the attention of the seller and he was offended and insisted that he bought them directly from Toms but there are clear differences between the Toms we purchased from Nordstrom (authorized seller of Toms) and the Toms we bought from Amazon. I'm attaching photos of the two shoes so you can see the side-by-side comparison. The really telling sign of fake Toms is that the insole comes right out of the Amazon Toms (barely glued in place) whereas the Nordstrom Toms have an insole that's firmly sewn into place. Additionally, the Amazon Toms have no arch support (that area is basically flat), whereas the Nordstrom Toms do have arch support. The canvas color is slightly different, the thread is slightly different, the shoes are slightly different heights and the Toms tag on the back of the shoe is slightly off-centered on the Amazon Toms. Finally the paper tags are slightly different as well. So you can decide for yourself if these are fake or not. I sent them back and kept the Nordstrom ones which were only about $7 more anyway.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue I am fairly certain that the shoes I received are fake. The insoles slipped out easily (they are heavily glued in the other pairs of Toms I've owned), and the insole stitching was of the wrong color (should have been beige stitching, like in the picture, not dark brown) The print on the insole was white instead of beige, and the letter spacing spacing and font were off The tag on the back of the shoe was far off from center, and the stitching across the entire shoe is inconsistently spaced The sizing was off. I have have a pair of size 11.5 Toms which fit just a tad loose, and the size 11 I bought from here were even biggerSave yourselves some money (and help people in the process) by buying directly from the Toms website. You'll most likely find a more interesting pair of shoes for less money, and you'll be sure they're actually donating that second pair.",Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue

Seller Issue I would have given a zero if I could. Wishom was who I bought these through. Third party seller. They are fake. I called them out on them being fakes and they refunded my money right away. Very fishy. Came from Hong Kong. Very upset Amazon is allowing them to sell fakes. They were good fakes. I ordered the same color and size from TOMS website and compared them side by side. The fakes were off on color. Too stiff. Couldn't bend the soles. The size was way off for an 8.  The sticker and flag they came with were off. This store was not an authorized dealer and should have researched more.  The fakes were good if you didn't know better. The real ones were softer material. Not stiff. The sole was bendable. The stitching was better. The flag and sticker looked like the other two I have. I have purchased two other pairs through TOMS website before.  The differences were there between the real ones and the knock offs.  They real TOMS sometimes require a couple times wearing them to break them in. I have a pair I have owned for three years and they are durable with average use. These fakes were so stiff I would have blisters instantly.,Product Authenticity Issue,Product Authenticity Issue
"Seller Issue It was my first Toms shoes, so I didn't know that it was a fake one until I got a second pair from Toms website. The insole is too big for the size, causing the shoes to stretch a lot, and the printings on the insole comes off after two days, whereas the authentic pair from Toms website is still intact after one month. As well, I compared the Toms sticker that came with the shoes and they have slightly different font style at the back and the colour is lighter than the authentic one.

"Seller Issue Update, Mar 2015This is an update to the original review of 4 stars I gave the product.No more than 3 months of use of the slippers, indoors only even though they are designed for outdoors too, the heel split on the side, shedding pieces of rubber from the inside all over the house, and revealing an empty space under the heal.I really tried to like this slipper, even dismissing a suspicion of it being a fake product by calling the manufacture to ensure that despite the different display on the web page (see original review below for details) these were originals. Nevertheless it seems the manufacturer did not bother to change the photo of the display, or comment that there might be different versions of the same slipper.If this is the case - the originals are, as others had claimed before me, a very low quality product and should not be sold by Amazon.Sure enough, Amazon, based on the evidence, decided to stop selling this product, and provide me with a refund for this purchase.Great customer service demonstrated again, and a good decision to take it off.Original review, downgraded to 1 starHaving read some of the recent reviews about the disappointing experience of getting a knock off, I was disappointed when my slippers arrived and were of one color, unlike the photo on the page. We called Amazon, and were pleasantly surprised to be handled by a rep who spoke fluent English for a change, who apologized on behalf of Amazon, and created a replacement for me at no additional charge to be shipped overnight. He suggested that if the second item is still suspicious we should notify Amazon again and they will take it off their site to investigate, and reimburse us of course.We thought it was a very reasonable solution, and when the (second) pair arrived the next day...they were the same as the first - one color.However, we did not notice any of the other defects that were described (and photographed) by other reviewers, so we decided to further check the authenticity of the item we received with Old Friend directly. We wrote the following email:Hello,We bought a pair of men's alpine slipper style: 481116 from Amazon. The picture on the Amazon website looked exactly like the one on the Old Friend website a dark brown upper with a two tone sole. The box it came in looked authentic. It was sold by Amazon and not a re-seller. The shoes we received were one color same for both the upper and sole. The sole did not have the two tones that the web picture shows. We are concerned that these may be knock offs. I have enclosed a few pics for your review.Let me know if these are your shoes.Thanks,(I've attached the photos we sent to this review).The next day we received the following response:Hello,The product you received is not a knock off. They are real authentic Old Friend Footwear Alpine Slippers. The sole is the exact same as pictured just one color instead of two.Thanks,Old Friend Sales TeamDirect: 9523585640Toll Free: 8005374361Sales@oldfriendfootwear.comWe also intend to notify Amazon about the misleading photo on this page, but we are convinced these are authentic.I'm giving them 4 star just for now for all the trouble we had to go through, however for now they feel very good - fit, form, warmth, and comfort.

The fit was great, and they were very comfortable.  The first time I wore them out for a full day was when I went to Disneyland with my friends and girlfriend.  It had drizzled the night before so the paths were wet.  The is the point where my shoes became banana peels and I began slipping all over the place.  On concrete, yep I'd slip, on wood, there I go, woosh like a downhill slalom olympian, those metal covers for utility access?  Boy if you stepped on those without looking, you'd be yards ahead of your friends before you knew it.I'm sad that these shoes simply aren't safe.  I work in residential construction and really like slip-on shoes when I'm doing inside work and am frequently taking my shoes off as I enter the house.  Slip-ons are just easiest.  Additionally, sneakers are generally more preferable to roofing jobs than steel-toed boots as you can grip the metal surface better.  I was hoping these would be useful there as well, but I wouldn't dare go on a metal roof with these things, if they can't handle pedestrian life, they don't belong on light construction projects.So in short, I wouldn't trust these shoes for every-day use, much-less my lighter projects, I can't afford to slip and hurt myself, I'd be unable to work.

I think NB tennis shoes have a reputation for being low to the ground, and my 803s were indeed lower than these K-Swiss.  They fit fine, length and width and the toe box was good.

The shoes were fine, but the converse box they came in was trashed and torn apart, and had tape holding it together. It looked like it was tampered with during shipping possibly too. This was a big let down to both me and my partner. Especially because she likes to keep the boxes of her shoes. Overall, the shoes were pretty nice. They had the bright colors we expected, and are not too cheap feeling. The only downside is that the converse logo on the side is not actually made out of the rubber side material, it's just been printed on with plastic, kinda like a t-shirt with a print on it. Which leads me to believe that these shoes are not actually converse, but a spoof, and a ripp off.",Quality Issue,Quality Issue

Even though they are monochrome the bottoms are indeed tan like all other converse. Don't believe me just check out their website and find the monochrome. It shows you the bottom of the shoes.

I think I got that pair with this order, at least I hope so because if all of them fit like this (I felt like my behind was on sideways all day and though they had some slack in them about the feet and ankles they were close to cutting off the circulation in my upper thighs and the waistline had to be pulled up practically to my armpits or else it wanted to be sliding down and visiting my buttcrack.....NOT a comfortable fit AT ALL!)

I'm constantly pulling them up in the back. My junk is popping out of the top and the sides! These might fit a woman comfortably, but not a man. There's no stretchiness or room in the front for the boys. This bikini would be better if Jockey offered it in other facrics such as Modal, Tactel or Nylon. I don't know why Jockey changed their design, but I don't like it and I will not buy this product again until they change it back. Sometimes change is a bad thing... and this is a bad thing!May sound odd, but Jockey makes women's panties that are FAR more comfortable compared to Elance bikinis for men!",Design Issue,Design Issue

"Product Issue I so wanted this bra to be ""the one"", but unfortunately I was very disappointed. First, let me be clear... my breasts are truly a force to behold. I mean, I'm a 38H and it takes a nation of millions to hold them down - or so it seems.  I have had a Freya and Wacoal underwire sports bra that have worked very well in the past, so I know it can be done. When I saw the reviews and the description for this bra, I felt like it might be yet another wonderful one that I could add to the arsenal.  But it was absolutely NOT that bra.  I read tons of reviews regarding the fit and how to measure and I measured myself and purchased a 4.  I was smack in the middle of what should have been a size 4 based on my measurements.  When I received the bra I put it on and the band was obviously the right size, It was difficult to fasten across my breasts - so tight I thought at first it may have been too small, but I was able to fasten the bra and then stuff my breasts into it - maybe not the way they intended to get it on, but hey - whatever works.  When I had it on and positioned my breasts in the cups the first thing I noticed was the significant lack of coverage and spillage out the sides of the bra. I also had monoboob and spillage out of the top. It was just not big enough to contain my breasts. The problem is a size bigger and it would have been way too big in the band.  Also, it had no adjustable straps. I thought it was brand new, and the band was pretty tight, so let me try it out and see how it goes.  So I wore it to my morning workout with my trainer and it was just useless.  It loosens up super fast and I was just bouncing around like a pogo stick. I mean when he said run and give me high knees, he got high breasts too. My breasts were like, ""Seriously?  This is no help at all.""  That's what they said to me after the workout.  I have already worn it so I won't return it.  I guess what I'll do is wear a regular bra under it and wear it on top.  Like so many other times, I end up wearing two bras so as not to waste the money I spent on some inept, unsupportive joke of a bra that my breasts just roll their eyes and shake their head at. Sigh. On to the next.",Design Issue,Design Issue

"Product Issue The size guide clearly shows that you are ordering in men's sizes.  I ordered a size 7B(M).  That is a size & in MEN'S.  That is a size 9 in women's .  What I received was a size 5 men's which is a size 7 in women's.  I find that to be the biggest pain in the butt.  It is hard enough to order Converse.  Amazon vendors don't make it any easier.  Some vendor sizes say men's sizes but the verbiage says stuff like, ""These are really women's sizes- so order them in your regular size- but make sure they are 1/2 size smaller than usual!""  errrrgg..  Converse are worth the 1/2 size calculation and even the men's vs. the women's nonsense- but when the vendor simply puts the wrong sex on the sizing chart- THAT is unacceptable.  Now, I have a shoe that is two sizes too small.  And I have to return them.  Thank GOD I ordered them via PRIME membership or I would be paying $17 shipping.  Wouldn't that be a real winner?

"Product Issue Perhaps mine was an anomaly, given so many positive reviews, but this bra was absolutely absurd! The band and underwire seemed good: very wide, some boning, plenty of clasps, not too wide a ""U"" shape, etc. However, the cups themselves were unbelievably small and conical. I purchased a 32DD, but it appeared to have been accidentally paired with a B cup, for all the lack of fabric! What little cup there was formed nearly point at the center- not precisely the shape I had in mind, even if I could manage to squeeze half a breast into each of those absurdly shallow cups! Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I don't think cones work well on anyone short of Madonna.

Certainly not me. Also, I'm a relatively thin 31-year-old. My bras do NOT require four hooks in the back. Honestly...It's a bit much.

"Product Issue These pantyhose are ridiculously too small. The waist is way too short and tight!  The crotch is too short!  Why don't pantyhose makers make the waist higher and bigger around?  This brand gave me a terrible muffin top!  What is ridiculous about the size is I read many reviews before deciding to order this brand.  I read a lot of good reviews how people liked this brand.  One person noted the waist was too short, so I purposely ordered the size larger than my range.  The size I ordered goes up a full 40 pounds more than what I weigh and I'm only 5'4"" - my legs are normal for my size - the crotch did not even come all the way up!  I was stuck and had to wear them.  They were extremely uncomfortable!  The waist was way too low!  After a couple of hours and keeping adjusting in the bathroom I was finally able to get the crotch all the way up, but the waist was still way too low!  Too bad for me I made a bad choice of ordering 4 pairs of this brand!  I wear a lot of dresses and go through a lot of pantyhose.  I will be going back to wearing Legs and Spanx though they are more expensive at least they fit right. I don't understand not being able to buy the size range that my body fits in and them not fitting!  It must be the makers are not using the right sizes or the models they use have all their weight above their waist!  My body is average and I'm not bigger on the bottom than the top - so this is really ridiculous.  These nylons themselves on the legs are not bad for strength but they became baggy at my ankles by the end of the day while my waist was being cut by a size that was supposed to fit someone 40 pounds more than me.

"Product Issue I wear a 36DD, and I'm always on the lookout for a good minimizer. I really wanted to like this bra. I have the Bali Satin Tracings bra, and aside from the seam across the bust (which can make wearing certain shirts impossible), I've been really pleased with it. However, in addition to that same seam issue, this bra has at least two major drawbacks for me. First, and most importantly, it's super pointy. It's definitely the case that it gives you a conical shape. On the one hand I can understand a slight conical shape, as minimizers are supposed to hold the bulk of your breast close to the chest -- hence the cone shape. Yet, this bra made me so pointy that it defeated this purpose, as the ""points"" extend really far forward! Second, for me, this bra doesn't do much in terms of separation. It feels a bit like a sports bra, in the sense that it feels like my boobs are being smushed together in the front. I think this is partly due to the strap placement. The pictures above don't really show this, but the straps are more toward the center of the breast, rather than toward the outer edge as most bra straps are. The effect is a slight pull toward the center, which creates the sports-bra-like, uniboob sensation. Not fun. Overall, I would not recommend this bra.",Design Issue,Design Issue

Red leather2. Matching checkbook holder3. Clear ID holder NOT in zippered compartment... snap flap/fold over OK4. 10+ credit card compartments that are NOT in a zippered compartment5. At least 1 main zippered compartment for cash and another zippered compartment (within main zippered compartment) for change6. Exterior pocket on the wallet... zipper preferred, no zipper OKThis wallet appeared to meet all of these criteria. It arrived within the estimated time frame, boxed, in perfect condition. Lovely red pebbled leather everywhere, all zippers slid nicely, and the snap fit securely in both holes. Everything seemed perfect until I tried to stuff my standard-sized Costco checks into the checkbook holder. The holder is at least 1/4"" too narrow; I had to chop off the sides of my checks to stuff them into the holder. Problem solved, right?NO. I could not close the darned checkbook holder. When I forced the top flap over my checkbook, I had to use a rubber band to hold it down, and the zillion digit routing/account/check number at the bottom was in complete view. It looks ridiculous, and I am beyond irritated every time I have to write a check for Girl Scout Cookies, school pictures, etc. The only reason I am still using it (rubber band and all) is because the leather matches the wallet, and I need another 100 hours to do research to find a replacement wallet/checkbook holder. Why, WHY do wallet manufacturers make gross, cheap plastic wallets anyway? They should know that anyone old fashioned enough to use a checkbook on a regular basis will want REAL LEATHER. I looked at wallets from $20 to $200, and I couldn't find another that met all of my criteria that was 100% leather.Enough of my ranting. I would not buy this product again, and I do not recommend it if you want a functional red checkbook holder to match your red wallet.",Quality Issue,Product Description Issue

I suggest not looking for something to hold Everything, but instead look for something very small to hold about 6 items of necessity, else you will always have a wallet about the same size.

I did have a item in just about every available slot in the wallet,  but did not have items in all of the pockets though.

I bought these primarily for lifting, but on most days it hurts my feet to use. Anyways, went to me local Footlocker and tried a pair of Chucks in 10.5, my general size for shoes and it fit perfect. Maybe it's just me, but I have regular, narrow feet and they felt fine. So much more comfortable that I ordered a pair on Converse.com because Amazon didn't have my size and they seem to be taking longer than 2 days to get things to my house. What's up with that?Long story short I'm considering returning these.",Design Issue,Design Issue

"Product Issue The zipper on my Kipling Lancelot Flap Shoulder Bag broke after five years of daily use. Replacing the zipper would have cost almost as much as replacing the purse, so I decided to buy a complete replacement.When the replacement came, I discovered it was missing an inner pocket that also divided the snap pouch into two areas! I carry my tablet and Kindle with me everywhere, and I always stow my gadgets behind this inner pocket. I also bring a variety of gift cards and other small tchotchkes such as headphones or validated parking receipts. The new Kipling Lancelot has no space for these items!Furthermore, the new Kipling Lancelot does not have the two little pen pockets. They moved the pen pocket to set between to larger pockets. Now my phone no longer fits in the pocket I usually carry it in!It's unacceptable. The manufacturing standards were obviously dropped to make the newer version of this Kipling purse.The 420 Denier Nylon used to make the purse is darn near indestructible.

I have a pretty average sized wrist, and the contact points barely met enough to keep the watch on me. To feel confident about keeping the watch on, the band would have to be tight enough to cut off circulation.

I expected more out of Suunto.....",Quality Issue,Design Issue

In order just to wear it the strap will generally need to be completely removed from the ""non-permanent"" side and then re-threaded back through. There's no way this is ""over-the-sleeve. The problem is that if one has to replace the original watch band a kit from Suunto is required in any case.  If you can somehow just get a hold of the attaching (small shallow c-shaped items illustrated) you could attach those and get a strap to feed through those and be set. Additionally, in order to detach/reattach the band two very small screwdriver type instruments are needed and it's still not easy.  This band is NOT elastic and does not stretch.  Read and heed. The materials and workmanship are not of high quality.  My 2-star rating is generous.",Design Issue,Design Issue

Unfortunately, I was told by several jewelers whom I asked about fixing the watch that it would cost me about the price of a new one to fix the old b/c Skagen sold the company and the new owners have TERRIBLE customer service.In short, this watch is not what I had hoped for.  There is nothing unique or interesting about it.  The key feature, for me, that commends the Skagen brand is its thin, sleek casing.  Clearly that is no longer the case, at least not with this particular model.  Not sure if they no longer manufacture that line anymore.  But absent the sleek look, I will select another brand and one that I know I can service without hassle.

"Product Issue I've had this watch for maybe 6 month now.I bought it simply because it was made of titanium and looked good, and I get metal allergy from anything else.  I first had a black skagen mesh watch, but it was not 100% titanium, and started to give me a rash when the paint wore off. This one is perfect however. I use it every day. It has gotten one nick in the crystal. It is my first watch ever not to give me a rash.I also have received questions like, ""Is that watch something special?"". So I guess it must look good.Update, I have to downgrade this watch. I have owned 3 Skagen watches now, and while they look OK, they are not made for every day use. On one the clamp eventually broke off, and the glass broke very easily on another (and the first one was far from hypoallergenic).  The clamp is  design issue. The band kept opening after even the lightest bump with the hand. Only way to get it to sit was to bend the clamp in slightly to increase the tension. But titanium is too brittle to bend well, so eventually, some months later it just snapped off. keep it on  At the price I'd expect something that last a few years.  Unfortunately there are not a lot of affordable options out there.  Ideally, there should be a watch with a soilicone strap, and a titanium body.",Quality Issue,Quality Issue

In expensive dress shoes and tennis shoes, I almost always wear a size 9 1/2.....never a 9 but sometimes a 10. I ordered a size 9 in these shoes and they looked  like 'clown shoes' on my feet. I returned them and ordered a size 8 and they are just about perfect although ever so slightly larger than my usual shoes. I can't imagine why they use such unusual sizing but I hope this information will be helpful. If you order a size and a half smaller than usual, I feel sure they will be right...or very close.Now......the not so good part. I am 66 years old and grew up wearing Converse tennis shoes all through the 1960s; they were great shoes in every respect. If your experience is similar, you will immediately realize that these shoes are in almost no way, comparable.

"Product Issue I didn't think I carried that much into work each day, but I had trouble putting more than a few small items and pieces of paperwork into this briefcase. It does not seal securely and I found that things (anything carried in the main pocket), would fall out without warning during normal use. Not fun to lose a cell phone or sunglasses! It's probably okay if you really only carry a few things back and forth, or have a set of screwdrivers and wrenches to carry around to jobsites, but most of the little pockets are so constrained that it was not useful for general use by me.It is rugged and it weared well for a couple of months, but I had to switch to something bigger and more secure in holding onto its contents. If the main flap went all the way to the bottom it would probably be much more secure -- the top flap barely overlaps the main pocket. Also, the central clasp makes the bag tend to fold in half around it. As a result you end up with a curved bag that looks funny and tends to warp pads of paper, instead of a straight bag more like a briefcase or messenger bag that keeps its contents safe.",Design Issue,Design Issue

The main color doesn't match the trim either.It's a shame too, because I really like the way the thing is made. It's sturdy and the material is heavy without being too stiff. It's comfortable to carry and the pocket layout is very intelligent and spacious. I would carry this thing for years if it was the color pictured.Overall, very disappointed.

Product Issue My son is 3 1/2.  petite for his age.  The ad does not say this is an inflatable piece.  He hasn't popped it (yet).  He's used it twice to accent his buzz lightyear costume.  The pack is an appropriate size for him.  There are very thin elastic straps with short Velcro strips to wear it like a back pack.  the problem is to actually wear it the jetpack can't be inflated complete.  The Velcro straps are too small to hold.  I am sure the design was meant to be small to hide the straps however this makes them difficult to stay shut & impossible for my son to put it on himself.  He's an independent kiddo so this causes him some frustration.  He's disappointed I can't inflate it completely for him to wear it.  He calls it broken because the wings sag. There's no separate blow in for the top of the wings or the ends of the wings making it difficult to evenly inflate.  Overall... it's a cute accessory but not worth the buy.  I'll probably try safety pinning to his costume for Halloween but wish I hadn't purchased it for him.  He wouldn't miss it if I had passed it up.,Design Issue,Design Issue

Product Issue Such an aweful product. They have ignored my calls and requests for a return.  Do not buy anything from CostumeHub. They do not care about their customers like they falsely claim they do.This thing arrived in a busted up box that looked like it had been stepped on.  I opened it to find a warped  and cheaply made helmet with super glue smeared over the visor.  This thing was awful. It isn't even fit for wearing since it was so bent out of shape and the bottom edges were razor sharp.  Such a bad buy.CostumeHub has no interest in conducting good business.

I could have gotten a better piece at the local s***ty Halloween seasonal stores, probably for half the price.  Do not buy -- it's not even worth the return shipping on it, and it'll probably get given out at my Halloween event to a kid as a cheap prize.",Quality Issue,Product Description Issue

"Product Issue Disappointed. This is a one-piece outfit - jacket does not detach. The major problem is that the only opening is the neck opening, meaning that somehow you have to get a toddler into a long-sleeved, long-pants non-stretchy one-piece outfit using only the neck opening. The only way I can use it for my grandson is to split the back several inches and sew in velcro closings. It will ruin the appearance of the costume, but will at least make it usable. The bow tie is not sequins as described, just cheap polyester. The hat is useless. It is tiny - would fit an infant - and the ears are very small - not like the picture at all. I'm on the search for an appropriate Mickey hat/headband to use instead. Sorry I spent the money on this.",Design Issue,Quality Issue
