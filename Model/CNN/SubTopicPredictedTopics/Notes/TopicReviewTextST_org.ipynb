Not terrible...but only barely worth the price (26 bucks) paid from a Gold Box sale.  It is NOT worth the listed 125!  No way.The bands are NOT LEATHER...some people state that they are, but they are most definitely synthetic.  I notice that NOW the item\\'s description has been corrected to \"synthetic leather\" -- when I bought it, the description clearly stated \"leather\".  One reviewer said they could tell \"by the smell\" that it was leather...but my bands smell just like a new shower curtain!  So believe the current product description: it\\'s SYNTHETIC leather.Overall, the bands are pretty cheap feeling, somewhat tough and inflexible.  The watch bezel is smaller than it seems in the picture.  My watch face isn\\'t even placed quite right -- the 12 o\\'clock position is just slightly off-center (!)The interchangeable face plates actually are what hold the straps in place -- you screw it onto the top and it sort of \"clamps\" down on the strap\\'s metal hooks.  It feels secure...ish.  For now, at least.The strap\\'s buckle is kind of sharp on the edges, and feels somewhat uncomfortable when I wear it.  I am starting to think 2 stars was too many...but it does work, and it actually isn\\'t too hard on the eyes.I have no doubt that I will no longer be able to use this watch a year from now...so if you want a gift for a teen or person like me who loses/breaks everything anyway, this might be it!  ;-)  But it\\'s not a nice watch that you could fool someone into thinking you actually paid 125 bucks for!', 'Too thin.', \"didn't fit right.

I am normally a 9.5 US in women's and found that the UK size 7 fit me best. When the boots came from Amazon, straight out of the box they looked way too small, but the tag and inside of the tongue both said 7, so I tried them on anyway. Although they were the same size I'd tried on in the store wearing 2 pairs of socks, these were way too tight even with 1 pair of thin socks. I have since returned the boots and gone back to the Dr. Martens store to buy the boots at full price.I would also like to add that the yellow stitching on the sides of the shoes looked very sloppy. I'm not sure if I agree with the other reviews that call these boots fake, but I do believe that they are a different quality than the boots that you get from the official store. You get what you pay for, I guess.\", 'Disappointed because I read the reviews saying that the helmet was the 2 piece!! It is only a 1 piece helmet.

They\\'re manufactured in India and there\\'s no label inside the boot stating what materials are used.

They look great but I've never had shoes that actually cut into the insides of your feet before. The uppermost inner stitch on the rear part of the elastic protrudes directly thru your socks and into your feet...making them bleed. Forget wearing them without socks. I'm not kidding. Maybe they changed their design or whatever but these are hands down, the worst shoes I've ever purchased. I even tried to clamp/press the offending nubbin flat with a Quick Grip clamp with little success. Perhaps after suffering through a few months of wearing them things will change but so far, one month into wearing them, they deserve the most poorly designed modern shoe award ever. Good penance shoes to go along with a horsehair shirt.\", \"but it is so small and made of such strong material (like an ACE bandage) I could barely stretch it enough to get it over my head. When I finally did manage to maneuver it over my shoulders it was so excruciatingly tight across my upper chest, I didn't think I pull it any lower, but I couldn't get it back over my head either, so I had to continue on with it!  I did eventually manage to get it where it should be, but it was so tight and uncomfortable I could not have exercised in it.  Getting it off was another hassle and I had to wrangle it down and step out of it, as there was no going back the other way.  I would estimate that it is almost 3 sizes smaller in band size than a regular bra. When I lose 30 pounds, I will try it on again as I think it would give a lot of support. I didn't send it back because of shipping and insurance costs. It would have been helpful if the seller had stated in the product description that the bra does not actually open up in the back (or front). I should have read the reviews before purchasing (the way wised-up readers do) because I saw that several purchasers who think the bra is great actually have someone help them get into it because it is so tight.\", \" I rate quality shoe I yet receive .I ordered December 13th ....

I paid attention to every little detail and it even fooled some people that work at a sunglass store. But I got a second and third opinion and they were surprised by what good of fakes these were. First of all the clear coat over the back of the arms that rests on your ears is a different shape from the real Ray-Bans. Look it up online to identify what I am talking about. The plastic part goes out to the right a little too much. Also, the etched RB that this company claims to have on the sunglasses is not etched correctly. Go to any store and compare them and you will see that the RB is eched on the inside of the lens not on the outside of the lens. You shouldn't even be able to feel it if they are real. We paid close attention to the shade of the blue and it is different from the real RayBans. The gold frame is lighter than the real pair and the writing on the side should have a space between the RB and the 3025. It should not read RB3025 which this fake pair does. Real Ray Bans have a different font and are more legible because it is written bigger and the code should read RB 3025 with a SPACE between. Very minor things to look out for. Don't let them get passed you. Pay close attention to the details because they're very hard to notice. They really have a lot of people fooled. The employees and I dissected these sunglasses and the shape of the lens is also very slightly different. Also, in department stores like Nordstrom and all the other places that sell the real product you shouldn't receive a fake tag. Normally it just comes in the box and the box has a bar code label attached on the side of the silver RayBan box. On this package, it is sealed very well on bubble wrap and labeled with a bar code over the bubble wrap instead and the label is most definitely not made by RayBan. Just so everyone is aware you can pay a small fee to get those made to make your business look legitimate. Also, they're so slick that they also customized a sticker to fake their authenticity because things like that fool a lot of people. The sticker reads that if the box or sticker appears unopened, it is because the package was opened during shipment. Trying, of course, to impersonate a legitimate and trustworthy business and trying make it seem like they're looking out, but really if they were then they would have delivered the real deal. This is not a reliable company at all and it's actually a huge deal because they are claiming to be something they are not. Last but not least, the one thing that got me up to go check a second and third time is on the clear part that sits over the nose the RB logo is not supposed to be the same on both nose pieces. One is supposed to be upside down and the other is supposed to sit forward so that it is legible. It's just something that you have to pay attention to because RayBans rarely have manufacture issues. These are definitely definitely definitely fake. Very good ones. But still fake. Stay far away from these sellers. They're nothing but a scam. Wonder if they know it's illegal? ? ?\", 'Although they may look pretty authentic, they are not. Nose piece fell off first day, took them to an authentic dealer for repair, they verified that these were fake.', \"Watch out, these are very clever fakes. They got me, don't let them get you too. If you go ahead and buy them anyways. Flick an authentic pair of Ray-Ban lens with your fingernail and listen to the sound. Then flick these lens and listen. You'll notice a distinct difference. I have 5 pairs of Ray-Bans I bought from ray-ban.com and they all have the same sound. The 2 pairs I bought from Hong Kong sound the same as each other, but different than the other 5 pairs I have. It's because they use a low quality lens and the color wears off. Please don't buy and support scammers.\", \"Authentic or fake, I don't know; but I can definitely say the New Wayfarers I bought from Sunglass Express are of lower quality than the pair I bought in 2011.Yes, the frames squeak and creak. Even though polarized, the light green G-15 lenses offer little protection from the sunshine. I found myself squinting through my $120 Ray-Bans. That's bogus. I was almost tempted to pop out the lenses and make sure they weren't polycarbonate plastic instead of the crystal green (glass) lenses I had been promised.Strangely enough, the RB2132 Ray-Ban New Wayfarer I bought from Sunglass Express is almost a carbon-copy of the $39.99 Kirkland Abruzzo frame offered by Costco. The only difference between the two is that the Ray-Ban front is flat across, and the bridge of the Kirkland frame is raised.I returned my RB2132s to Sunglass Express. I kept the Costco frames.\", \"They're fake. I returned them. Went to sunglasses hut. Got real ones.

I'm pretty bummed out as I purchased this with the assurance that the item Ships from and sold by Amazon.com. when I ordered it. I was invoiced by Amazon LLC/ Amazon Export Sales Inc. Upon reviewing this in greater details, I realized that this is a really good fake. Passes most tests, but 3 things gave it away: the case, the plastic-like finish of the gold, and the upside down R-B logo on the nose pad.

Amazon is showing that this item is being sold by MagentaShop obviously with absolutely no needback.\", \"I have worn Danskos for 13 years and for all of that time I've been a size 38. When these shoes came I was so excited, they are so cute, but they are about 4/5 the width of my foot. I could barely get them on, but I really wanted them so I tried walking up and down my hall. The top of the boot pressed down on the top of my shoe and I have no arches (I have flat feet). My husband suggested they would stretch out, but after 5 minutes my feet were throbbing and I had to take them off fast. Throbbing feet from 5 minutes is not what I know Danskos to be. My experience of a Dansko is that I put them on, even brand new, and my feet rejoice. These shoes are impostors. Beautiful, but fake.

Mine did not.4) There was no Emu fold-over label at the very top of the boot, which is typical of this brand.So, sadly, my boots appear to be fake & I've notified Emu Australia directly that these were sold to me by this particular company (Fusion Apparel).Beware when purchasing.\", 'These are 100% fake.
