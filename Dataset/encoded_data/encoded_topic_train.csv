Too small,1
This costume is not the correct size that it is labeled ass! Like 2 sizes smaller than what it actually is tagged as. No good. Had to return it.,1
"The leather is of a different quality than my older pairs, it is thick and fake looking.The SQUEAKING was horrendous with socks when I wore pants. I stabbed the stole 10 or 15 times to make the annoying & embarrassing noise go away.NO LUCK! It took me around 8 months of regular wear for them to quieten down. In the future, I will pay more at Belk's to own a pair, because OBVIOUSLY quality offered here vis-a-vi departments stores is much lower.",0

"Sadly, the bras that were received were made of a synthetic material, with no cotton lining whatsoever and had underwire. I purchased these for my 90 year old great aunt. I would give zero stars to the seller. The one star is for the promptness of Amazon's shipping. We would return, but my aunt threw all the packaging away and insists that they'll be okay. But the bras are nothing like the photo. Additionally, there is no cotton lining, as listed in the product description and the bras have underwire, which also runs counter to the description. I have purchased many items through Amazon over the years - large & small items. This is only one of two negative experiences and only the first wrong item received. I will not order from this seller again.",1
Very poor quality. The wheels are plastic and very small (see photo) for the size of the backpack.  An inner pocket is terribly misaligned (see photo). Technically speaking there are only 4 pockets (not 5 as listed in product description) in which you can place your items.  The 4th so-called zipper pocket is not a pocket it is simply an extension.  When you remove the shoulder straps the back panel opening (with Velcro) you must find the matching Velcro to attach it to.  In my case it is missing.  There is no warranty or limited warranty attached to the backpack. The Sea-Tac Rolling Backpack did not meet my expectations.  I am returning it tomorrow.,1
This backpack that I ball it's not real it's a fake because the button start falling off the first time I use it. So I decided to take it to an actual store and they told me it's 100% fake. I would never buy from this buyer again I have I would have just spent the extra $30 to buy the real thing. So I actually did buy the real thing in comparison the fabric is a lot thinner and is not waterproof like the real thing. You can see in the the video.,0
"I was not impressed with my purchase.  The broom looked nothing like the picture.  Specifically, it hardly has any bristles.  I would not recommend purchasing this.",1
"Ordered in August, work in a dental office, no abuse to these shoes. They fall apart",1
" Unfortunately , pant simply far small wear .I wear 38x32 jean , dress pant , work khaki , name - multiple different brand n't fit exactly alike , I usually ca n't go wrong sizing .When I tried , I AT LEAST 2 '' even fastening .The 38s fit like 34s ...I sending back , since sizing n't even close .The tag show `` Young Men 's '' pant , may run small , unless I missed something , I n't see anything `` young men '' product description , even , one would think size 38 size 38 , .",1
"I forgot why I quit buying these mocs, but now I remember. The sole breaks down quickly, leaving an uncomfortable saddle under my arch. Boo. From experience, I know this will get worse until I have to throw the shoes out LONG before they wear out any other way. It becomes crippling.",1

These are fake knock offs. I own a pair of patent beige flats in the same size I ordered so I can compare easily. These are not comfortable and they cut into my heels. Fake!!,0
"I purchased these about a year ago. I cracked one of the lenses by dropping something on it, totally my fault. I went to the Luxottica website and followed the process to send them in and get them fixed. It's supposed to be $15 if it's not covered under warranty. Luxottica sent the sunglasses back to me, lens still cracked, stating the glasses have no identifying serial numbers that match any Luxottica sunglasses makes/models and as such they would not repair them.They seem to be pretty decent quality glasses and are nice looking, but they are without any question fakes.",0
"Definitely fake Jacks!!!! I got these in April and by May the silver part on the heels were coming off. I had to super glue it down. It came apart again now (June). I recommend just going to the Jack Rogers site directly and buying them. It also says ""made in Dominican Republic"", which is another clear sign of them being fake. I wish I could get a refund:/",0
 Gave away friend .I 'm XL figured 3X would safe tight even 3X.Also Delivery Slow .,0
Too narrow. Uncomfortable. Probably won't risk ordering any kind of shoes in the future.,1
" Was disappointed .The color costume match picture hat absolutely terrible .Made foam , gray black arrived large crease prevent horn standing straight .The horn flat foam , rounded stuffed , another thing tell photo advertisement .The costume plenty large adult even though say 12-14 .I normally wear 18 loose .However something funky neck -- 's like size armhole head fit without cutting stitching .Overall disappointed -- likely last time purchase costume online .",1
 The t-shirt fit expected made good quality material .The decoration bit washed acceptable .Delivery however took month disappointing .Turns supplier China must shipped proverbial `` slow boat '' .,0
Has ripped the moment they came out of the box I didn't even get a chance to put them on,1
It's too large,1
"this color shrank in one washing in cold water and cold air drying , to being uncomfortably tight. I noticed this one was made in Haiti , the other 2 colors I got were made in guatimala and Honduras and they were fine same model Tshirt different color.",1
 These leather stated product description .,1
 Pearl show called `` Ivory '' lighter advertised ( one many shade listed ) .It I expected .Not worth driving return .I buy hosiery person unless I find exact product worked .,1
" This product come shown picture .Even second one , definitely like one I bought store .Very disappointed .",1
" The picture Amazon packaging show pattern back dress .Mine patchwork pattern front back super light pink , thin sheer fabric .",1
These shorts run way to small. I understand what the top reviewer said about them running true but the issue lies within Dickies. I'm wearing a pair of their shorts right now that are a size 34 and they fit perfectly. I ordered these in a 34 and they're way to small. I would get it if these were 2 different brands but the same brand should run the same sizes no matter what.,1
"The vest looks really nice, and it even fits nice.  HOWEVER, I got this vest to sport my gold pocket watch that my wife got for me.  I wanted to hang it from one of the front pockets, but when I got the vest, I was VERY disappointed to find out that the pockets are false pockets.  Nowhere on the product description does it bother to mention that the pockets are false pockets.  I would not have purchased this vest without the pockets. FYI...the two front pockets are false pockets!",1
I was disappointed because I ordered my size but they were way too big for my feet. I need to return them.,1
"I compared the backpack I received (left, red) to a Jansport Superbreak backpack bought from a store last year (right, blue). Size of the one received from this seller is smaller, fabric and zippers are very cheap feeling, and it is clearly a fake Jansport backpack. I want this backpack to last, but I'm afraid even unzipping it could break it. Returning and will order from a licensed store.",0
"Bought these as an xmas gift last year, and they fell apart in the summer. Have purchased a new set from a local store. I've had pairs of converse that last years, even w/ tears in cloth. This pair i bought at this store began to separate the rubber sole from the cloth. This leads me to believe that this pair was a bootleg pair with shoddy workmanship. I could be wrong, but I've never had a pair of chucks flap apart the way these did.",1

I was excited to get my Toms 2 weeks ago.  They fit snug at first but after wearing them almost every day they have stretched out a bit and feel more comfortable. Only problem is....they are now coming apart at the sole.  I'm so disappointed. I've read reviews to see if my Toms are fake or real and from what I've read they are real but I'm very disappointed to be returning them.  Next time I'll just go directly through the Toms website and not be so concerned with getting a good deal.  Actually $45 for TWO pairs of shoes is an excellent deal.  Think I'll go shopping now at www.toms.com.,0
"So, my comments are based in the overall escalation of the shoe. While the finish looked very good & the shoe seemed to be comfortable  the size was extremely large. I had read this in other comments and ordered smaller because if it. Typically I wear 11 wide (EE) & on occasion 10.5 Wide (EE) depending  on brand. I thought I'd be ok with 10.5 but these shoes are enormous. So big that I'm not sure I can estimate the correct size. Usually, one can say I would like a half size larger or smaller but with these shoes I am contemplating a size 9.5 W or maybe even a 9...they are that big; hence the two stars.",1
"LISTEN TO ME: I struggled over finding the right jacket on Amazon for the right price for father in law who just bought a motorcycle. I would not give this jacket to ANYONE! Came in the mail, could smell the stench of weird plastic and chemicals as I opened the plastic. The jacket is so much like black cardboard. If this is leather then it is leather from a 200 yr old, over processed water buffalo. Idk what I'm even trying to say, other than this is junk. Literally. There are white scuff marks all over at the corners if the collar and the stench is insane. A fake leather jacket would be nicer than this. I kept thinking maybe some of the bad reviews were from really picky people who had outrageous expectations. No. They are right. Wouldn't buy this at a garage sale. I'm mailing it back right away for refund and now desperately trying to find a replacement gift. DO NOT BUY THIS. WASTING YOUR TIME AS YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY RETURN. Trust the bad reviews. Look at pics. Jacket is so hard is stands up ON ITS OWN!!!!",0
"These hose a way too small according the page size. I use to wear the exact same hose and they always fit fine.  Have not gained weight from time I use to wear them, Very dissatisfied,",1

Discouraged at delivery packaging which was a tight plastic evelope and moreso at torn nike box it came in. It was a last minute gift so had no choice but to keep it. Put tape across nike box and tried to wrap it wrapping paper but still looked deformed. The sandals look as advertised but not too comfortable.,0
"I loved the former version of this bag. It was leather, the card slots were more numerous and on one flap. There were more interior zipper pockets, and a nice little loop for a pen so it was always handy. This version has eliminated or reduced these features. The faux leather is stiff and looks cheap (which it is). The snaps on the pockets don't work smoothly. I tried this one time. Items fell out. Wish they'd go back to the original version. It would well be worth a higher price.",1
This turned out to be a microfiber fabric which I won't wear. They were too big. I gave them to charity. They were beautiful but not for me.,1

" The broom received definitely pictured .There twig tied instead thick broom shown .I 'm definitely crafty purchased first place I ca n't even fix , time get replaced !I recommend shopping around local online store buying one .",1
Size was at least 1 - 1.5 sizes too large.  Color is PINK not purple or violet.  Shipper required me to pay return shipping and it has been 10 days to date with no refund.,1
"Hmmm... not even a month and the case stitching is unraveling.  While watching a ""how to spot a fake"" video, I passed my nail over the paint on the inner right arm and the paint came completely off.  The RB etching on the left lens does not line up with the arm; mine is slightly above. Lots of things check out on these and a few things don't. I have serious feel it's fake.",0
These were knock off/fake Reef sandals. They are already falling apart. The bottoms are not the real Reef brand logo. DO NOT BUY THESE!,0
"We ordered the gray and white version of these socks, which are advertised as ""Seamless"".  We selected the appropriate size based on my son's shoe size (Medium, for shoe sizes 12-6) since he wears a size 13 boys shoe.  The socks that arrived are so large that I can comfortably wear them (I wear a women's size 9.5 shoe, the account is listed under my husband's name).  I included a picture of the sock on my adult foot to show how large they are.  (I did not have to stretch the sock to get it to fit my foot).  In addition, they are not seamless.  Not even close.  I included a close-up picture of the seam as well.  The product description is extremely misleading, I'm not sure how the sellers can get away with marketing these socks as ""seamless"".",1
I recently purchased my third pair of these shoes for work.  I have to go though a metal detector at work so having a shoe without metal in it is very important to me.  I owned two pairs of this exact model previously and loved them.  However to my disgust the have added a metal shank to this model.  Not only does this now set off the metal detector (I now have to take them off every time) it has also stiffened the shoe making it uncomfortable for breaking in.  I had blisters on both heels after the first day and it is still causing discomfort on my right heel after I have worn them 4 days now.  Very disappointed Dockers added the metal as they used to be a great shoe for me.Updated:  Would give these a 0 star if I could.  After only about a month of use the shoe began falling apart.  The shoe is now mostly fake leather that does not last and looks terrible.  Will never buy Dockers shoes again!,0

"I don't like control top. if you're already wearing a skirt or tuck in your shirt or have something around your waist, this control top deal makes you feels like you are being squeezed to death. it's just too tight and uncomfortable and really it pushes in some places.",1
"I have worn Sambas religiously since 1995. I LOVE them. My third pair is wearing thin in the sole after 8 years of constant wear, so I thought I'd order a replacement pair. These are horrendous. I'm pretty sure they're fake. I really hope they're fake because I can't believe Adidas would downgrade their classic shoe so drastically. They're made of some sort of plasticky faux leather, and the sizing is about a half size too big. I'm returning these and headed to a shoe store. More money, but at least they'll be leather.",0
runs huge and looks fake,0
"Decently made shirt, but VERY rough and thick. Tag says Made in Mexico.... Kinda disappointed for a plain t-shirt that's almost twenty dollars....",1
These are not authentic Ray-Bans. They were fake and when you compare the laser etching inside the lenses to real Ray-Bans you can see they were fake. I assume that if you compare them to actual Ray-Bans and compare the laser etching on the INSIDE of the glasses you will see what I mean when I say they are fake. Do NOT buy these glasses. They ARE fake.,0
I have been wearing these shoes for years. I ordered the same size I have 2 pair of now and they are at least a size smaller than previous pairs. A size 10 is no longer a size 10,1
"On my average-sized legs, the tops of these knee-highs were really tight with minimal stretch & they cut off my circulation which was not great on a long plane trip. I'm disappointed.",1
The posted colour did not match the actual colour of the shoes when we received them.,1
"The bra was very hard to put on.  It had to be fastened in the front but then it was too difficult to turn to the back.  Once I got it around, it felt small.  The 3/4 length ended up being too short.  I'm short waisted and thought this would be better than the longer style but it didn't.  The cup size was not as expected.  I normally wear a C cup but this B cup was too big.  I also prefer a slightly padded bra so that the seams don't show through.  Definitely need a front closure so this has to go back.",1
"The size is ok, but too narrow, and not at all comfortable. I love these shoes, but need a wider width, which seems not to be available.  Thinking about returning them, but I don't like having to pay the return charge.",1
"Purchased black converse size 12 with white trim (selection was available in color and size as was described by photo).  What we received was black on black monotone.

WAY too small.... I'm returning them.,1
"This item was ordered at least ten days before Halloween , regular delivery. It was for a Mario Brothers costume my son intended to wear. It came two days after Halloween. Amizon delivery dates are inaccurate, so If you need it by a certain date , don't use Amazon.",0

"I don't know. They look weird, the sole's soooo different from my picture of converse!!! Buuu",1
"I was not impressed with the quality of these.  I wore them once and had to throw them away.  Initially, I somehow managed to get 2 small holes in them within the first hour - no run and in a hidden spot, so not the end of the world.  By the end of the night, after having them on for 6 hours, there was a huge hole at one of the toes.  I had on open toed shoes, was not walking around outside nor dancing.  I was standing around or sitting at a table.  Very disappointing (and embarrassing!!).  Next time I will try a different brand.",1

"I wanted a classic and clean looking shoe. The Converse Chuck Taylor fit the look I wanted!Unfortunately, my job requires me to stand ALL day and by 2pm my feet hurt badly when wearing these shoes. It was my 2nd pair of Chuck Taylors and I got a larger size THIS time because I thought the 1st pair was too small. WRONG! It does not matter what size-They just have NO cushion at all.",1
"The reason I didn't like it is because it wrinkles really easy and it's hard to get the wrinkles out. So when I go to grab it out of the wash and wear it, it's too wrinkled to wear in public.  I don't have the time or inclination to try to iron it so I guess it's an around the house shirt now.",1
"Super low quality, colors aren't movie accurate at all and is overall very cheap- you will be disappointed",1
"These shoes say slip resistant in the product description and they say slip resistant on the bottom of the shoe - on a sticker as well as a small, hot-orange oval near the heel.  Are they, though?  I'm sure they would have been if the tread on the bottom of the shoe wasn't already completely worn down when they arrived.How does a ""new"" shoe have no tread?  Seriously.  I don't understand.  I think East Bay sent me used shoes, but I don't know why they would have done that.Anyway, I fell at work on Wednesday.  No one saw and I didn't say anything, but I was pushing a couple of chairs and the tile floor was wet.  All of a sudden, I felt like I was standing on ice and the chairs weren't moving, but my feet were.  I landed on my hip.  Luckily I'm 25 years old, so my hip is fine, but it was painful and it sort of hurts to walk up and down steps right now.In short, thank you East Bay.  Thank you for my ""new"" pair of *used*, worn down, treadless, non-slip-resistant shoes.",1

"I ordered three pairs of Ugg's from Amazon this winter. Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake.  The fake Ugg's had the holographic tag, came in a box with a holographic sticker, and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED.  The boot itself smelled fine, like sheepskin, but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals. I could smell it before I'd even pulled them out of the box.  Real Ugg's do not have this smell.  Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself. If you receive Ugg's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic... return them, they are not authentic.  If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies... it's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots, Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs (apparently they now are), however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are.  If you visit Ugg's website, you can find a list of authorized sellers.  Unfortunately, as I discovered, several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor.  So be careful.  Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $180 for the classic tall.  You will not find authentic Ugg's on sale, reduced, or anything like that at any authorized site.  If you want real Ugg's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland, Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer.  I love my Ugg's. I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow.  My toes were toasty warm.  Very comfortable.  I'm very happy!",0
"It was cute, but too small for my 15 month old, even though she's really tiny. The material felt very scratchy. All in all, not worth the price or the time.",1

They really need to fix the sizing chart on these.  I bought what was supposed to be 9.5 US mens and they are more like 11.5 US mens.  The shoes even say inside 9.5 US but they are not that size.  They are made in China.  I am returning and will reorder but am not sure what size to order because they sizing chart is a cluster F@#$%.,1
"This is the fake one! Definitely! The box is damaged, the glass didn't even have a package,just directly put in the bag. The frame is kinda loosened, like anytime it would broken! Don't buy it!",0
The arms are extremely wide and the zipper doesn't move down. It's extremely thin as well. Ugly.,1

I really like Chuck Taylor shoes and these aren't my first pair. But they are the first pair that have started to fall apart after 1 month of use. Not really falling apart but developing holes throughout the canvas. Not sure what's going on but I'm very disappointed.,1

 Not impressive person picture .,1
Everything was joy until my skx stop working after 9 months of use without submerging it and taking good care of it. When I sent it to a Seiko authorized repair center they told me that the watch has been opened in the past and a rubber seal was broken and left inside. Basically they told me that my watch was not new when I bought it. Even when the product description said it was new. I have the invoice and I can get a authorized repair center opiniion if clarification needed.,1
I specifically wanted leather converse the description said that they where leather when they came they where not so I don't understand where I went wrong in my ordering,1

"I had the same problem as another reviewer where after 2 months the watch started getting slow by several minutes a day. I replaced the battery, didn't help. Sent it to the manufacturer for repairs, and they sent it back claiming to have fixed it, but the problem persisted. And I was out the shipping & handling costs. It is nice-looking, but not a good timepiece.",1

They make my wife feel like her skin is on fire.Incorrect fabric claims is inexcusable.",1
They were COUNTERFEITS -you think after 30 yrs of buying K-Swiss Classics that I couldn't spot a fake! Sizing not correct poor quality leather and construction! Send back for full refund. I'm still learning. Careful what you believe in reading when shopping on the Internet! First time with Levi's! They were fakes too! NOW KSwiss?  What's true and what's scams and where's my perfect world they promised us when we were kids in the 1960's?,0
"It seems like something has changed in the sizing.  I've been a 48 in birkenstock of all types since I first purchased birkenstock.  I did once have to buy a smaller size (46) because I was in a bind and I ended up buying another (correct, 48) pair a couple weeks later.  This feels like that smaller sized shoe, like a 46.  The box says 48, the inside of the shoe says 48, it's disappointing",1
although the clips were good the over all stretch of the back elastic was very poor too short and didnot fit at all they were to tight I did not like them  and  could not wear them. to bad!,1
They were bigger than expected.  Almost 2 sizes too big for me,1
"I am giving this product 2 stars instead of 1, because they seem like they are extremely well made and will last for a long time, but it has failed in about every other aspect, especially for its price range.1. Does not come even close to fitting, this shoe fits like its 1-2 sizes bigger than stated, and i specifically chose a smaller size to make sure it would fit well.2. it has NO grip on wet ground or rock, it is more slippery than my normal sneakers.3. it purports to prevent odor, but after only wearing them about 5 times,  well lets just say that claim stinks...4. They are easily the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn in this price range, I have even worn $10 shoes that where more comfortable, the backs of these shoes press at an odd angle against my achilles tendon, making it quite sore by the end of the day, and my arch is pretty sore after wearing them as well.5. No real ankle support at all, that is likely do mostly to being so loose though...I honestly just do not understand why such a universally loved shoe and brand has turned out so absolutely horrible, maybe its just me, but these are not worth even half what i payed... i wish i could say different though, as I had high  hopes for these, as I purchased them for work, which includes a lot of varied terrain, I really need a good shoe soon :/",1
"The matching earrings are for some reason a much nicer quality. The necklace rope measured 14 inches and the pendent made it just under 16. The metal quality is sturdy but looks fake like costume jewelry. For the $36.99 I paid, I'd be willing to say it was a fair price for the quality.",0

"The pair of boots fit just as a I imagined it would. I normally wear size 8 for boots for women and I purchased a size 6 and it fit my feet fine.

As a matter of fact, the logo is the same color as the boots which is a mustard yellow.  I also do not see the serial numbers every timberland boots should have.

"I understand that the suit needs to leave some room for a fake (or real) belly, but it's still far, far too large.I typically wear medium or large size t-shirts and jackets, and pants with a 32-33 waist. Obviously not all that big, but I'm certainly not tiny either. Yet you could fit two of me into the jacket, and at least three of me into the pants. The belt? Even worse.Even the beard hooks/straps/whatever are loose, leaving the mustache area hanging just below my chin.If you're on the short or slender side, even if you're planning on using a fake belly, understand that this is not going to fit even remotely well. You will look like an absolute clown without some serious, time-consuming alterations which end up looking not-quite-right.",0
Wasn't pleased with the size chart. It wasn't clear enough on what size I was buying. When I returned the shoes because they weren't the right size I had to pay for shipping.,1

"While Ray-ban is a name that is synonymous with quality sunglasses over the years, these particular glasses are definitely not what you have come to expect. I have a rule of thumb to follow when purchasing expensive products: if they seem cheap and fake, they are cheap and fake. That's what these glasses are for sure. The frame and lenses look really good from a distance (as evidence from the photo here), however, when you get them up close you realize exactly the kind of quality you are receiving. When you pay more than 80$ for a pair of sunglasses you expect quality; but unfortunately that is not what you are getting here.It makes me think that there is something amiss with these glasses: some people get authentic Ray-bans, but some do not. I am not sure if this is an Amazon or seller issue, but just be really careful when purchasing these glasses. I recommend the American Optical Google 58s; they are sturdy and durable, look cool and hip, and best of all.....they are made in the United States. So with the American Optical sunglasses you get a great quality item and you're helping keep jobs in America.",0

I purchased these UGGs from DECKERS Outdoor Corp and they were fakes.  UGG lays out very clearly how to tell if a product is authentic and these are not.  As boots they are fine but they are not authentic.  When I called Amazon they didn't help and they have refused to post my reviews stating the problem with the authenticity.,0
"I am always puzzled at the fan service paid to Oakley; they charge a very high amount for their products, which in the experience of this buyer, either don't do what they are advertised to do, or break after less than one year.  And, seeing as how Oakley PRIDES themselves on being the top choice for athletes and ""Special Forces around the world"", I'm not sure how they keep getting away with it.  Prestige is a powerful thing, I suppose.First off - comfort.  These boots are comfortable, for the first two weeks.  After that, the inner lining of the boot, which is nothing more than upholstered padding, is worn off by contact with the foot.  And this was just from me walking around campus.Second - the fit.  I ordered a size down, and there was still nearly two inches of space for my foot to slide around in.Third - the ""waterproofing"".  Don't be fooled, ""waterproof"" material and ""seam-sealed"" construction will give you a waterproof boot; unfortunately, these boots are lacking the latter.  So, the waterproof material of the boot beads and channels water into the seam of the tongue that is not sealed, and places it directly on your foot.  I stepped in water 3-4"" deep, and it ran into the shoe like I was wearing a pair of crocs.  I find it weird that none of the other reviewers mention this, but they are probably still too busy staring at the ""O"" symbol to ever fathom that something could be wrong.Finally - The price.  I don't really need to extrapolate, if you are going to sell something for this much money, it better perform.  I highly doubt SF teams are deploying wearing these, and if they are, they are having to buy new boots after each rotation, and wrap them in duct tape when encountering water over 10 mm high.Seriously, go buy some Danners or Timberlands, and get what you pay for, instead of feeding the money machine that is Oakley.",0
"I've ordered Ked's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality. The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $5. No support, thin canvas - just junk. I'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe. I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to. No support, no padding, more narrow, thinner canvas. I've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference. Save your money. You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $5-$8, it just won't have a Keds tag. This is no longer the bargain it once was. Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator. What's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe don't even know it's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago.",0

"Usually I never give one star but I have to say I was disappointed in the weak fiber of these nylons.  They were an add on item so I didn't expect that they would be extremely durable but a one-time wear was not what I expected either.  I was extremely careful once I wore the first pair (I bought three) as they ran without any provocation.  Also, I normally wear an AB so I ordered the B to make sure they wouldn't be stretched too tight.  They were loose around my ankles but I loved the sheerness and control top was perfect.  Too bad they couldn't hold up.",1

"These came in a Sperry box that said ""Made In Indonesia"" but then the inside of the shoes said ""Made In Dominican Republic."" They definitely seemed fake to me. On top of that, the bottoms were pretty scuffed and dirty, as if they had already been slightly worn before. I had ordered a 9 W in women's and they were still pretty snug on the sides, which was a surprise ordering wide. The toes were quite long though and a little too big, so the sizing was definitely weird. We compared them to a pair of original Sperrys my dad owned and there were definitely some differences in appearance and texture. Leather was much rougher on these ones and the markings on the bottoms were different. For the same price as originals, save your time and just get the originals. At least they're guaranteed to be authentic.",0

"First, I have to say, I love Franco Sarto shoes, and this is my 5th (yes 5th!) pair of this shoe.  I walk long distances to work, and they are very comfortable and stylish (compared to walking downtown in gym shoes!).Over the years I noticed the leather getting a bit lower in quality.  This particular recent Franco Sarto shoe purchase is rather poor.  The leather nearly looks like pvc, the inside is now all fake leather, it smells bad, makes your feel smell and slip & slide.  The bottom insole is very cheap, glued in poorly.  The material is ""pleather"", smells bad, makes your feet sweat and smell bad, in addition to a slip & slide type of feel. The heel is seems to be painted a slightly different black compared to the leather.Overall, Franco Sarto's cost cutting is very noticeable.  As much as I love this shoe, this will be my last pair.  I understand keeping prices constant, but I would have rather paid the $10-20 more and had a better quality, truely ""all leather"" shoe.",0

I found the shoes too heavy for tennis. The cover over the laces made it difficult to pull the laces tight.  I cut off the cover and that made it better.

"XXL = 43-47"" waist. A 4"" range isn't realistic. 46-47"" is more like it.If accurate waist size info was included in the product description, I suspect this product would not be returned so often.Otherwise these seem like really nice shorts.",1
Way too small even the belt was too small. Returned and got Carharrt shorts. Way better.,1
"the size, the French purse, and color is what I wanted, and the number of card slots are numerous/useful, but I'm underwhelmed by the stiff leather and difficulty is using the card slots.

I used to love Buxton products for leather quality in the past--guess, like everything else today, cutting corners is the norm.",1
"Got a run in the 1st pair the very first day I wore them. Used fingernail polish on the run and wore again, but another run started on the same knee-high.  After only 3 or 4 uses, the other knee-high now has 2 runs as well.  Interestingly, the runs are all in the reinforced toe!",1
"As a long time,satisfied customer of Amazon.com I was shocked when I received these earrings purchased for my wife. The quality was very poor.

Cheesy material. Poor fit. The ratio of base diameter to height of the cup (for this size bra) is way off.,1
"I am 5'3"" and about 200.  Based on the size chart, I ordered the largest size and they BARELY fit.  Could have been a tad longer, which is bad considering I'm a short person, and any snugger and I wouldn't have been able to wear them.  And after only wearing once, they got a huge snag in them.  Not just a teeny hole, but a huge snag that ran all the way down the leg.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is that the color was as expected.",1
fake.....,0
"These are made wtih ""stretch"" fabric, though that is not mentioned anywhere in the product description. They were snug, but tolerable, when I first got them, but after a few washes, they got very tight. Basically, they went from jeans to jeggings. Also, the stretch fabric does not breathe well at all.",1
They run horribly small and I wish it had noted that somewhere in the product description.  The sellers are even worse.,1
"I have worn this exact style bra for many years and purchased the same size (& bra style #) I have been wearing with success. I will point out that those bras were previously purchased in a local department store. I assumed I could order the same size and style without difficulty, & I expected they would fit just as well. I was so wrong.This bra that I loved so dearly in the past fit so different when purchased online. The cup size was too big and gathered at the top of the cups leaving pleats of fabric. (Keep in mind I ordered the exact same brand, style number, & size that I last purchased at a department store and was wearing comfortably.) Also, the materials and construction were not up to par when compared to my bras that were purchased in a department store. This bra had to have either been a ""second"" quality bra or a fake based on just how different they felt, despite the tags being exact copies of the ones on my store-bought bras.I would have given this just 1 star, but I added a 2nd one for the pricing and ease of return. Thank you Amazon for always being so dependable!",0

"I have worn this style of Florsheim shoe form many years, but this is the first time the quality seems really poor.  It makes me wonder if these are real Florsheim shoes or Chinese knock-offs.  I have had them less than 2 months and after about 5 weeks, the gold dcor on the top is broken and falling off.  I find no known way of contacting the seller and Amazon won't take anything back after 30 days, so I guess I'm stuck with them, but I am not satisfied with them as I have the MANY other previous pairs of these shoes I've owned before.  I am convinced these are NOT REAL FLORSHEIM, but cheap knock-offs.  The insoles have buckled and creates a lump across the inside which make it extremely uncomfortable to walk on.  I do NOT recommend these.  Pay a little more and get the REAL THING at the shoe store.UPDATE: The gold decoration came loose after a few months and has now stretched the strap so much, it sags, the decision sides around and looks ridiculous, and is unmistakably a fake and not a real Florsheim.  I'm disappointed Amazon slows this illegal junk to be sold under their name.",0

Unfortunately I waited too long to return this item. I put them on for the first time today and got a blister after taking about 15 steps in my house. The sizing must be off from what a size 12 would normally be.,1

The shoes are falling apart around the ankle on the left shoe. It looks like the stitching is coming apart and you can see the inside material. I feel that this should not have happened. I have only had the shoes for four months and it doesn't make sense that only the one shoe is coming apart. I have owned K-Swiss shoes before and have never had this happen. I feel that shoes amazon send me are a fake. I am very dissatisfied with how they are falling apart after only a few months of wear.,0

I didn't realize from the picture that these were almost identical to those until I put them on. They do look like shoes for little kids, just in a bigger size. I'm all for a casual look at times, but these just look immature and uglier in an adult size. Also, the arches felt very high and the faux suede did not look like it would last.  The same material on my son's shoes looks very bad after he's worn them for a month.

"The length fit me as it does the lady in the picture and I am 54 tall, so if you are much taller, expect the dress to fit shorter. The lace around the neck is itchy, the fabric is soft and warm (like a snuggy wearable blanket - 100% polyester) and the elastic waist makes it so that even women as large as myself (190 lbs), or larger can wear it without it feeling tight. Label says hand wash only and fits up to a size 14 (which I am). I think even a woman size 16/18 would fit it though. The material looks like it would pill easily, but I haven't worn it yet. What I HATE about it (aside from the lace neck) is the apron. It is not attached to the dress and the way you have to put it on is a bit ridiculous and makes it looks ugly and cheap from the back. Since I am larger, the neck of the apron doesnt reach the neck of the dress like it does in the picture either. I do NOT like the costume, hat is fine, I wish it came with some fake white hair attached to it though. I did not return it on time, so I guess Ill be trying to sell it on craigslist :/",0

"I did not mark this down because of the watch.  I have worn this watch for several years.  I am very hard on them and they will usually last for years before replacement despite being bumped/shaken/hit/dropped/submerged/exposed to numerous chemicals etc.  The saying take a kickin and keeps on tickin (well not ticken this is digital) holds true with this product.  The features are simple, and you cannot beat the indiglo function on one.  The reason I marked it down, is it never actually showed up.  I ordered it, and a few days after its expected delivery date it had not shown up.  I contacted Amazon, who responded the next day saying they were looking into it.  2 days later, I got a reply from Amazon saying the purchase price had been refunded to my card.  I ended up going to a local store to purchase this watch.  The watch itself was great, however, I will not be pruchasing anything from the ""Timex Store"" on Amazon ever again.",0

"I ordered this pair of sunglasses for my husband as an xmas gift.  I felt secure in the purchase because this was originally listed as 'sold by Amazon' as opposed to merely 'fulfilled by Amazon'.Well, something changed I guess.Unfortunately, I cannot speak in terms of the seller because I cannot say who ended up actually filling this order, but it wasn't Amazon.I would also like, at the very least, to say that I received a fake pair of Ray Ban aviators, but that is far too generous.  A fake implies that some effort was put in to make the product mirror that which I thought I was buying.  Wouldn't that be nice?  But nope.  I received a random pair of 5-dollar aviator sunglasses with a Ray Ban sticker on them.  No markings on the frames, no markings on the lenses, not even the slightest effort made to trick me.  To that I feel somewhat insulted.  I cannot imagine a world existing where a person would receive this product and think ""awesome, just what I paid $150 dollars for!!""  What a joke.Because I made the specific effort to assure I was ordering directly from Amazon and still had my order fulfilled by some random seller, I would encourage any shopper looking at this sort of item to walk away, save your money, and spend a few more dollars for the privilege of not getting ripped off.  As a long time Amazon shopper, I can say that my confidence in this company has been significantly shaken.I love xmas - it gives me a chance to finally spoil the people who I love and who do so much for me throughout the year.  Thanks for finally allowing me to bestow upon someone an awful pair of random sunglasses in a ripped up, fake Ray Ban box.  A dream come true.  Unbelievable.",0

"I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume.  Unfortunately, when we blew up the jet pack the day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour, it began to deflate quickly.  We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material.  Luckily, I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in my city which held up fine on Halloween.",1

"I have had a Tilley hat in the past and was looking forward to getting LTM5 hat as a lightweight option.  It has a good look and a good shape, especially when you see the pictures online.  Unfortunately, the delivery did not meet expectations.  The hat came in a small box and when I opened it skeptically, I found that the hat had been folded down into 6ths and stuffed into a plastic bag.  The brim was creased at each point and no amount of time spent shaping it would give it an appearance better than an old booney hat that had been stuffed in a pocket.Tilly hats are renown for the ability to pack it, but they always recommend pushing the crown down and packing it with the brim flat.  It may have saved the hat to have shipped it in this fashion, but when the brim is permanently creased at points all around, it looks terrible.  Not the high-end experience that I was expecting, considering my happiness with my old Tilley hat.  I will not comment about the quality of the hat, the craftsmanship, etc.  It would be unfair to do that considering that the main reason to buy this hat is for the look, comfort, coolness and how it holds its shape.  None of which I could do, considering I could not get past the inability to shape the brim into any wearable configuration.Rather than giving a vindictive 1 star, I gave a 2 star rating because I am not sure with whom the fault lies.  I have a hard time believing that Tilley had shipped it out to retailers in that little bag, considering that it is their recommendation that it is stored flat.  The sticker on the bag made me believe it was the retailer (Think Fast) that packaged it that way, but it could have been Amazon since they fulfilled the order and shipped it out.I am hesitant to reorder through Amazon for another hat, as I do not want to duplicate the issue.  I am sure with all the positive reviews that I have read, that others have not had my experience with how it was delivered.  I just wanted to give feedback on my experience so that others could make an informed purchase, and so that the party responsible for this situation could benefit from changing packaging practices that led to my being delivered an unwearable hat.",0

"I have the Lodis Audry-Brera Briefcase in black w/ red trim.  I liked it, and had planned to later purchase the briefcase with wheels.  BUT...It appears that this item is some kind of cloth with a very thin coat of leather bonded to it.  I discovered this yesterday when the loop for the strap broke and the bag fell to the ground.  I at first thought the metal piece had simply slipped out, but upon inspection I saw that the loop formed by the strip of ""leather"" had simply torn in two at the stitching. I wouldn't expect that from leather, and closer look showed little threads at the edge of the loop!  I showed it to my fellow engineers, and we all agreed that it was not leather, that these were threads.  This is not what you pay close to $300 for!  I bought mine in the mall, but it was about that price.  This is outrageous!!!!  Just wish I had figured it out sooner so I could have returned it.  I don't like spending my hard earned money on fake junk!",0

"I was always told ""you get what you pay for"" and this proves it. This costume is needed for a performance coming up and when I tried it on to see if I needed any alterations, something felt very strange.

"I ordered this watch and when it came in it looked nice, but I made the mistake of not opening the box when I received it. I gave it as an early Christmas gift (luckily because I was just barely in the 90 day window to dispute the charge through my CC company) and after it was opened, I was handed the watch and I immediately knew it was a fake just by the weight alone. The days are in Spanish and there is no feature on the watch to change it to English. I have purchased many titanium watches and none of them have ever been this light in weight. When I e-mailed Joma Shop about my issue they 1) politely informed me that they have a generous 30 day return policy that I have exceeded and 2) informed me that it is indeed an authentic Seiko watch and I should go to my nearest jeweler for them to tell me the watch is authentic. When I responded to inform them that I will not be going even more out of my way to have a jeweler assure me of authenticity of a watch I know is not authentic and that I disputed the charge through my credit card company and Amazon, I did not receive a response. You're better of going to your nearest Wal*Mart to purchase a watch because it will definitely be sturdier than this Seiko knock-off!",0

"I just received my Ray Bans. I was so excited to have found them $40 cheaper on Amazon than in the stores. This should have been my first clue. I got them out of their packaging and watched a few online videos about how to tell if they are fake. First off, these did not have the The Icons booklet that comes with real Ray Bans. Next, I tried them on and they fell right off my face. The ones in the store fit like a glove. Also, these are incredibly lighter than the ones in the store. Lastly, they do NOT have the metal bar running through the arms.Needless to say, I will be returning them to Amazon (luckily they were the seller, so I can get a refund) and going to purchase these in person like I should have done this weekend. Fool me once... :(Review edit- evidently, the new wayfarers don't have metal through the arms in order to make them lighter; however, these were still huge on my face ( the arms were bent weird) and didn't come with the icons booklet. Just bought the real ones elsewhere and love them!",0
Size was much larger than expected,1
Description said it was 100% leather when in fact it is a small percentage of leather. The only leather part is the outside. Everything else is the fake pleather material. You can see the slight difference in brown color and texture between the fake and real leather.  The parts where the wallet holds your cards and money are going to receive a lot of wear and tear because you're constantly taking things in and out of it so I don't understand why they wouldn't make the whole wallet leather. Instead they just lied about it being 100%. I think this is why some other reviewers had problems with it breaking down so quickly. I will be returning it and getting a real full leather wallet.,1

Not comfortable from inside ... So dispointed,1
"These were sealed in plastic and obviously brand new, so I was rather surprised that the fabric had a strong perfume scent.  After a wash and dry cycle, the scent persists.  It seems the manufacturer has determined that a deodorant was in order...?  Strange, given that we also got Jockey briefs for men another time and they were definitely not scented.  So wow.  Way to turn off fragrance-allergic customers.  I'm kind of surprised nobody else has mentioned the perfumy smell in the reviews, so maybe this was a new thing or one-off.  Possibly I could be convinced that a permanent scent could be miraculously imparted to the cloth through the plastic by accident.  Maybe.  But I'm not going to take the chance.  I'll stick with other  choices.Update: Turns out there is at least one other review that warns of the scent.  I should have looked at all of them before buying! It truly didn't occur to me that they might be bathed in fragrance at the point of manufacture.Update: 4/25/2014 - Just to update things, I've washed this underwear 5 or 6 times since I got it, and the scent is still strong.  It's just not fading.  They were so pretty and nicely constructed, I kept them, hoping the fragrance would go away, but now I see that wasn't a very bright idea.  I haven't been able to wear them after the first time and they are making the container they are stored in reek.  I think it's time to throw in the towel, so to speak.",1

According to levi.com, amazon.com is NOT an authorized seller of Levi's jeans, which means you are apt to get a fake. It's not hard to tell. The fabric is a good place to start, and the fit. I sent them back and of course, I got a refund, but I just wanted people to know they may not be getting what they think they paid for.",0
"This watch is receiving a single star for its disappointing size. You would think that it would have suitable dimensions,( hence the title ""Men's Watch"" ) but I assure you that this looks like a child's watch on a man's wrist ( had I wanted that I would have ordered a Disney watch). Furthermore, after reassessing the product description, it list the watch under the women's department... Thanks Whoever ",1
Great shoe's!! Wish I didn't spray protection on them before I tried them on? Way sloppy fit for supposed to be the same size? I guess I should have just gone to a store and bought new pair!!!,1
"Don't be disappointed. This wallet is ONLY leather on the outside. The ENTIRE interior is vinyl. In fact something you can't see in the photos: embossed on the wallet is ""LEATHER EXTERIOR"".

A cheap cast off perhaps, but NOTHING like my last Buxton.",1

"FAKE NIKES - 99.99%sure this is a fake nike product.  Crappy quality shoe, you can see the yellow glue coming out in several places, much more than would be allowed by a real nike product. Sole is harder rubber than all my other nikes.  Flyknit is very stiff.  No reflective quality on any part of the shoe.  The insole is not attached and is very poor quality, no nike swoosh.  The underside of the tongue does not have the typical label like all my other nike shoes.  THe label on the top of the tongue is different that my other nikes too.  Came in a nike box but according to some youtube videos I watched on how to spot fake nikes, the label and box are consistent with the fakes out there.  No price on the label.  Corners are not rounded.  Should've trusted the other reviews saying these are fake but you always want to believe.  IF you don't care they are fake and you just want to wear them for show, they are probably fine, however don't plan on exercising in these things; they are worse than Walmart quality.",0

"First let me say I have been an owner of these Merrell shoes for years. These used to be the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Unfortunately, Merrell has changed the sole from a comfortable cushion-like material to something more like a truck tire. To their credit, the new design is much more durable but sacrifices comfort. They are much heavier than the previous design. I look forward to taking these off after a long day of work. When these wear out, I'm off to find a different brand.",1
"For me this is100% fake. For one, the material is very thin and and loose and they fit very tight on the waist, which most Levis do not. Levis mark are not exist. Normally it says Levis all over the jeans. Another concern is the tags on the inside of the jeans, which are only tags with Chinese writing on them and only say Levis in very small writing on the bottom. The stitching also seems kind of crappy to me, not like any of the other Levis I own. The last concern is that on the tab on the back pocket, it just has an R on it, no Levis. Please comment if anyone else had this issue or know anything about how to spot counterfeit Levis",0

"Purchased a few of these during the Prime Day sale direct from Amazon. I usually try to avoid purchasing name-brand clothing online, but since these were through Amazon and not a third-party seller I was reasonably sure I would be getting a genuine pair of Levi's. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. When compared to a pair I purchased at a department store a few weeks prior, these are clearly of inferior quality and fit.Overall the denim is much rougher than other pairs of Levi's I own. The front pockets are also ridiculously shallow; they can barely fit keys let alone a cell phone. After one wash they shrunk to the point where I could no longer wear them. The department store purchased version has none of these problems.The most obvious suggestion that these are fakes is the zipper. Genuine Levi's have the name stamped on the zipper: these do not. They also have a tag on the inside of the jean with the style number: these do not. Another oddity is a bizarre message written in stilted English on the inside front pocket which tries to convince the wearer that these are genuine Levi's. If the jeans feel the need to preemptively make their case that they aren't fakes, it's not a good sign.Hopefully Amazon will straighten out any issues with their source and either start selling real jeans or discontinue selling the fakes.",0

"Hi! I was so excited to get this slide in size 6 in the pink and brown. I have 2 other pairs of slides made by Crocs that I had purchased at Dick's. One of my other slides is black and gray but it is the same exact style as this one. The other slide is similar but a cris-cross in the band. Both shoes I have are in size 6. I normally wear a size 6 1/2 in sandal and a 7 in shoes.I talked to Amazon customer service today and told them they were fakes. I was surprised she didn't act like it was a big deal. Maybe I was talking to someone overseas?Ways that I can tell they are different:1. The fit is completely different and they run very small2. The material feels different when I walked in them. The other 2 pair that I have feel the same. These don't feel as cushioned and the bumps on them are very pronounced and stick into your feet.3. The bottom of the shoes have one of the little notches cut off (looks like they pulled it out of a shoe mold?).4. The little alligator's bumps on the button are different than my other 2 crocs (barely can tell, I looked at a site that says it should have 6 bumps and the 4th one down is larger than the rest).[...]",0

"On the first day of use, I noticed stratches on the bottom of the band. According to the details, the band is made up of Titanium. I work in the bank, and my table is made up of wood. So what's going on here? How did wood scratch my Titanium band? Is the wood on my table surface more dense than the Titanium on the band?90% of why I got this watch is because it's full Titanium, and I didn't want stratches at all! Everything else works on the watch, and it looks okay. I'm just sad over the dreadful scratches.Just to make sure the wood scratched the Titanium band (and not something else), I dragged the Titanium band over my wooden desk with a slight press to see what would happen. And guess what? More Stratches over the Titanium band.I can't even return this item because of Bodying's first return rule:""1. All returned items must be new and unused, and in unworn condition. All items must be returned with all the original packaging materials. The white security seal must not be broken and must be fully in-tagged with the watch as the same condition as we shipped to you. We're sorry that we are unable to accept any return merchandises without the security seal attached.""In the end, I'm sad over this new watch which I ended paying over $220 for.

These are FAKE jack rogers! Its really disappointing to realize that Amazon sells fakes. I own many jack rogers and this pair clearly does not match the high quality the brand typically represents.

I have a pair of Skechers and a pair of Dockers slip on shoes that are both a similar style that cost less than half as much and are made with much more durable materials. The sole of the Helsinki appears to be a semi-soft foam that feels extremely light and not durable at all. The ""leather"" is very thin pleather that again seems incredibly weak and after only trying the shoes on for fit and walking no more than 10 steps the leather shows significant signs of creasing and wrinkling. Unless you want to get ripped off by paying $150 for a shoe that is worth $30, DO NOT BUY THIS!",1

"The fit of this shoe is fine length-wise. It may be a tad too wide for some people, but I don't like my toes squished, so I thought that aspect was perfect. What differed significantly from the product description was their claim of ""great support"" only to receive a shoe that was practically flat. No support whatsoever in this shoe. I have very high arches and insteps, so this shoe very uncomfortable. Trying them on when they got here... I felt my arch pronate immediately due to the lack of support. I wouldn't be able to wear them for long walks, which is the intent of the purchase.Pro:- They are cute. I bought the navy blue and it's a great generic color. Cute cut outs on the top and slim toe. Looks feminine.- No bothersome heal area, but a strap to keep them from flip-floppingCon:- no arch support at all- straps are stiff. You'd have to wear them in prior to a long walk or you might get blisters.I'm returning mine as the arch support issue is a dealbreaker.",1

"First off, I'd like to state that i absolutely LOVE Converse.  I've been waiting to get these for the longest time, and this price is the cheapest. To say I was excited when I placed this order would not cover it in any way, shape, sort, or form.Now, the review.The seller literally sent two different sizes. The left is the correct size I ordered, and the right is one size down.  I ordered this shoes for an event, and I really tried to make the size difference work, but after shoving my foot into the right shoe, I knew it wouldn't work.How do you even manage to send two different sizes? and this sucks for whoever gets the other mismatched size pair.After abusing my right foot with these mismatched shoes, I looked up the return policy. I knew that there was no way that I would get a new pair before my event, but I at least want my money back.  As I went through the return policy, it seems like theres no free return shipping.Greaaaatttt.shipping for shoes is expensive.  Returning shoes that I was extremely excited for but ended up being my worst Amazon (or any other online store) experience, is not only annoying, but also stressing on my wallet.  It's not MY fault that these people some how managed to put the wrong shoes in a box and ship them to me.And guess what? these shoes in my size are now out of stock.  So now not only are my hopes of exchange ruined, but so is my chance at getting great shoes (and hopefully not another terrible experience) at a low price.In conclusion, these shoes are great.  Trust me, my left foot felt great in the size that I ordered (and I'm sure my right foot would have felt great too, had it been the right size).  thats about all the good stuff I can say for these shoes.As for the bad, these shoes-one was the wrong size-now out of stock-have to pay for the return shipping-contacting seller is pointless, as the shoes are out of stock, but I can't find their email anyways-generally bad experience.So, just cough up the extra 10 bucks and buy the CORRECT sized shoes from a different place.",0

"I ordered these sweatpants based on the product description.  After wearing them once, small ""pills"" developed all over the pant legs.

Features a light-up feature and solid chain."" & ""The engraved metal timepiece has a light-up feature and solid chain for sturdiness."" I could tell before even opening the packaging that it was not sturdy. It appeared plastic, with a plastic piece that attaches the chain to the watch. The chain does not look or feel metal at all, nor does the watch. It looks plastic and feels like it my be tin, at best. Very fragile feel to it, like it will bend, mark or dent with little effort. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR IT'S LISTING PRICE. The most I would spend on something of this quality would be $20, tops. VERY overpriced at $54.99.",1
"These boots simply don't look like you would expect when ""Made in the USA"" is on the box.  The zipper snap was about to fall off on both boots.  The finish looks sprayed on as others have commented and the leather almost looks fake.  The leather of the tongue is so thin, I'd imagine the laces would dig in and get pretty uncomfortable quickly. I also have a pair of Hathorn Explorers and there simply is no comparison.  Corcoran either needs to charge a good $50 less for their boots, or up the quality and price to a point where people won't be disappointed.",0

"I ordered a 7 wide BIG KIDS boot and received a 7 toddler.  The company that sold it initially was not accommodating when I called about the error and not until I wrote a bad review about the poor customer service did they give me the care and attention that they should have initially.As for Timberland, i will be boycotting their products based on their CEO and Sr Vice President of Marketing's recent remarks about not wanting to see Blacks and Latinos in their brand on December 3, 2014.  I'm sure they must realize that those two ethnic groups put the Timberland brand on the map, making it relevant and a mainstay in the rapid growth market of the urban arena.  Shame on them for speaking publicly about their position as they have lost my business and hopefully the business of everyone I know and that reads this review!",1

"This review is for the company, not the product.After a long search for a bra that I would be comfortable in, I finally found this one. I loved it. It actually felt comfortable.However, on a recent trip home, unforeseen circumstances caused me to have to replace them. Just a couple hours before leaving for my flight, we receive a call that a close relative was in the ER and really not doing well. We bolted out the door to the hospital. Even so, I was only able to stay in the hospital less than an hour before rushing out the door again to catch my flight. The only reason I was able to make it on the plane was because my flight was delayed. But this resulted in me leaving all my luggage at home.I came back to school with minimal undergarments and immediately purchased a replacement. I was disappointed to see that this company does not subscribe to Amazon's prime shipping, so not only did I have to pay for shipping, but I also had to wait more than the expected two days. The delivery dates comes and goes, but I give it a couple more days to see if it was just an error. Nope. The package never arrived. I contact Moving Comfort's customer service, and they only finally replied today. Not timely at all. I ask for a refund for the original package and reorder a new one. Not only do they not refund me, but they tell me to take it up with FedEx, and that they will not be delivering my second order until I change the delivery address. Even so, they don't refund me for that order either. Logic much? Obviously, this company does not care for its customers. I will be taking my business elsewhere.Stay away from these heartless money mongers.",0

"This product cannot hold its ""wings"" shape for long. My son is all excited, but it does not impress me. Not worth what I paid. I am going to keep it because there is no other choice/option available (that's life, I guess)It needs some hard-material in the frame somewhere. Expecting the air pressure alone to keep the shape is a bit too optimistic.",1
"On my first flight with this bag, it came off the plane with the stitching on the top flap of the main compartment undone leaving a fist-sized hole. I could easily have lost items, if I had anything smaller than a shirt inside. One star is too much for luggage that fails on first use.",1
"I was really excited when I saw these rain boots with a wide calf opening because I have been frustrated beyond belief to try on boot after boot and barely get my foot in because the calf opening was too small! Well, I got my foot into these but wasn't sure I could get it out. The size 8 felt like a size 7 (and I normally wear a size 8--I know the product description says if you're a half size, go up a size), and the wide calf wasn't that wide at all. If I wore these boots with shorts or capris, it might've been better, but I prefer to wear rain boots with all types of pants. It feels weird to write this, but I don't have massive calves; I just don't have calves as small as my forearms.I think if I had gotten a size 9 it would've been better, but I also didn't want to risk buying boots that were too big and have my feet sliding toward the front of the boots with every step I took.",1

"My wife purchased these; first time out of box, getting ready to go to a wedding, they tore almost immediately.  She was not happy.",1
"I purchased these for a costume and thought they'd be great to hold onto as slippers/comfy shoes since I thought this brand was supposed to be a higher end slipper. They're terrible though. Made cheaply and very uncomfortable.When on, they don't look terrible. I got a lot of complements on them, they look true to the picture. However when you take them out of the box you'll notice the poor fabrics quality, terrible finish and uneven seams.Sizing: They're cut narrow and while the body of the shoe does stretch out a little bit, the ribbon they use as edging doesn't so it cuts into your foot. I wear an 8.5-9 and have a narrow foot. I purchased the 8.5 bc of other reviews and they're too tight. I should have gone with the 9. So if you're in between sizes def go with your bigger size.There is no cushion, no support and the material inside doesn't feel nice or plush or anything that you'd normally like in a slipper. It's a gross cheap material that you'll feel catch if you have dry spots on your feet.Lastly, these are 100% house slippers and not good for people who need stability in their shoe. The outside sole is just leather. There's no rubber or anything. So it's like walking around in socks, you'll slip on slick floors and if you go outside they'll get torn up. So not a great option for grandma.Lastly- I ordered them with prime shipping and they still showed up 3 days late. They were guaranteed for a Tuesday delivery but came on Friday. Too late for me to order another pair for my party when I realized how tight they were.Overall, these are aweful. I can't recommend them for anyone or any use. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the outside does look decent and true to the photo.",0

"Based on how lovely the first pair of earrings that I ordered from Gem Avenue were (the little turquoise and black beaded ones pictured and sold now as a due with these)and the rave reviews here, I was anxious to add these to my wardrobe.  But sadly, these aren't at all like the first pair though they closely resemble the turquoise pair in the pictures. Simply put I wouldn't have purchased these at all had I seen them.  They are a flat cheap looking silver mounting, and the blue (stones??) are much darker than pictured and honestly they look like plastic beads from a cheap jewelry making kit!! According to this ad, these earrings originally sold for $40 and are now on sale for $20!  I would've walked away from them completely had I seen them in a shop.  I WILL give Gem Avenue a star for prompt delivery AND the earrings were packaged beautifully sealed in a tiny bag inside a nice gift box. But the product itself is sub par.  I can't believe these earrings got all these stars!!! I am returning them for my $20 that I can spend on products with this same company that ARE far and away more superior.",0

"We got this for my son for Halloween this year. My son is almost 2, about 24lb and it fit him pretty well except for the helmet. The helmet was too big for even me and I'm a 200+lb adult male. Unfortunately there was a huge problem with the way this outfit was designed around the neck. There's a thin very sharp piece of plastic that goes around the entire neck that the foam is supposed to protect your child from but it does a pathetic job. My son fell once while wearing the outfit and the sharp plastic above the eyeball cut up his neck and underneath his little chin. After putting some bandages under his chin we had to put tape all over sharp plastic edge before we could continue trick or treating. It's really a cute outfit and we got some great pictures but it's stupidly designed and dangerous right out of the box for kids to wear.",1

"We bought this for our 3 year old son because he refused to be anything else for Halloween.  After getting this product in the mail (5 stars for shipping!  We received the item very quickly.) I'm extremely disappointed in the quality, and the price.  I've seen this advertised for as little as $19.99 and as high as $32.99 when it shouldn't be priced any higher than maybe $9.99.  The material is hardly any stronger than that thin foam wrapping that is on new electronics when you take them out of their original boxes.  Last year my son wore his costume several times because he loved it so much...it was a $10 chicken costume.  This year I'll be surprised if we make it out of the house to go trick or treating before he rips this costume.  Oh and the hat...NOTHING like the one in the picture.About my ratings:I gave it a 5 for fun because my kid wants nothing other than to be Thomas for halloween and he'll be SO excited to see his costume when we give it to him.I gave it a 1 for educational value for obvious reasons.I gave it a 1 for durability for the reasons I stated above.Overall I'd give this costume a 2.",1

The differences: these cost $7 less, are made of a material that feels lighter, have an expandable waist, and don't have a cargo pocket on the left leg. I prefer the heavier material in the Crossover pants in colder weather. I didn't find the expandable ""comfort waist"" to be comfortable. I was surprised and disappointed at the lack of the left leg cargo pocket. Weighing these differences, I decided to exchange these for the slightly more expensive Crossover Cargo pants. Yes, yes, I know I should have read the product description more carefully.",1

"I bought four of these shirts some years ago on the advice of a friend who lives in them.  From the start they seemed like quality material, albeit stiff and itchy.  I managed to ruin one of the shirts, which was entirely my fault.  Of the remaining three, two self-destructed within a year.  I recently found the fourth at the bottom of a drawer.  While technically wearable, it was still itchy as hell and I decided not to torture myself any further, so it became a rag.  I've since moved on to the Duluth Trading brand, which is a quantum leap in durability, comfort, and the lack of an obnoxious logo on the pocket.",1
"too small and the Nike symbols fell off, it appears fake.",0
Bought as a Christmas present and Ive never been more disappointed. Its says Hyper ORANGE not bright pink. The look on my daughters face was devastating. What is wrong with converse? Is someone color blind? Never ordering anything like this again. Not true to the actual color.,1
"The product arrived 2 days after the delivery date and a soon as my wife opened it, the zipper broke. I have sent it back (at MY expense)so we shall see...Not happy.",0
I purchased these thinking they would be silky like the ones I have purchased in the past from the store.  They are rough and not silky like Silk Reflections normally are.,1

Now I must return it for another one.  Very frustrating.  I don't know if it would have made any difference had I ordered it directly from Timbuk2, the product ultimately is packaged from the same source.Update:  I sent the first bag back and Amazon promptly sent me a replacement bag.  However the replacement bag is also missing the cross-strap.  Again, the product description on Amazon says it is supposed to be included.  I contacted Amazon using the chat function and was just told I should return this second bag for a full refund, and they will initiate an investigation to see what is going on.  Intolerable.

Is every bag I order from you guys going to be defective? How can I get the cross-strap?Kisha:I'm sorry for the trouble your having with his order. what I will have to do is have you return the items for a full refund and have an investigation started by pulling this from the websiteMe:Alright. I will go through the procedures again for sending this back, but this time for a full refund.

"Best thing about this order was the shipping. Shipped quickly after ordering and arrived earlier than expected.The glasses are just ok. From reading previous reviews, i thought these big glasses would be just right for my ""big face"" but be warned, they are pretty big.Also the color of the glasses is much lighter than the picture. I was specifically looking for black gradient glasses and these are a purple lens. Not even the frames look black.The most disappointing thing about this order though is the fact that the product description says the glasses include a lens cleaning cloth and this cloth is also included in the photos yet I received a (somewhat useless) bag for my glasses. The fact that the description stated the glasses came with a case and a cloth is part of the reason why I purchased them, along with the color, so I'm feeling pretty duped. I was going to purchase the amber version of the glasses but I've definitely changed my mind.",1

I was a little disappointed because I ordered women's chucks and somehow got men's.  I knew the fit was a bit larger than women's but didn't realize it was intact men's until after I had already worn them several times and couldn't return.  I still wear them some though.,1
too hard to put on,1
The pair of Uggs I was sent from What's Hot were fake Uggs.  Luckily I had read the reviews by others who had received fake Uggs and knew to check for the marks/signs that let you know whether the boots are authentic Uggs or not.  Very disappointed and frustrated.,0

"Do not waste your money! These are not your typical nylon so they ""hang"" (wrinkle up around the knees and ankles) as you wear them.  I was mortified! I was wearing a skirt and the material stretches as you wear it, bend, etc. I had to take them off and go without.  Into the garbage they went.  On the positive, they are sheer, which I liked.",1

As my attached photo shows, only one side is printed on.",1

"My pair of Clarks arrived last week.  When I took the shoes out of the box, I wasn't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes (like I thought) or a cut-down version of a boot.  I went back and looked at the picture on-line and, sure enough, I got what I ordered.  This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe.  With the four eyelets, this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit, plus it looks goofy. The leather, if it really is leather, looks fake.  I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered.  I also would never wear these shoes with jeans (if you do, wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek).  All in all, I give the product a 2.  I would send them back, but it's not worth the bother.  Instead, I'll wear'em when I work in the yard.",0
"I would give these negative stars, if I could and when I get a chance I am going to email both Amazon and the company that sold these to me.  I don't think I will be able to get a refund because I bought them a year ago to replace an another pair of Ugg's.  I kept wearing my old pair, and every time I put these on I would think, ""Gee, they are not nearly as comfortable.""Finally, I really looked at them, and it turns out they are FAKE.  There is no decal from UGG, they run small, and it's fake fur not sheepskin.  I would say that for fakes they are a pretty good replica, but so annoying.  I love Amazon, but no more shoes from them.  Lesson learned, and the sad part is, it's not like I saved a lot of money.",0
"I was misled by text in product description claiming product will remove ALL push pins from watchbands.  I was careful to be sure that band was properly aligned and that force would be applied to pin to be removed in keeping with the direction of the arrow shown on watchband. After bending two of the supplied mandrels, I stopped. The tool was not capable of holding the watchband square to the mandrel. The tool is not up to the job, and the cost of returning it would be more than its worth.  Save your money! I have bought several products over the years from Amazon and previous descriptions of product capabilities proved to be accurate, I relied on their word -  Somebody really goofed on this one.",1
"I really wanted these sneakers. Unfortunately, they still did not fit well even after using the size suggested by the sizing matrix - the width was a little narrow and the sneakers still had a ""too long"" feel to them. Returned them.",1

"...and a nickle on gluing the sole to uppers as they always start to peel off in the first 6 months or yr. even with only a few hours per week wear. The plastic stiffener failed on one early making the shoe almost impossible to use as the broken end protrudes and stabs into the soft part of my foot. I like the style,fit, feel and quality in most respects but they should be much more durable for this price.",1
"The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered. I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box, they were completely black. There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones.",0
"See the pictures I uploaded under ""Customer Images."" The color is one thing, but the sandals I received were NOT leather. They felt like stiff rubber. We bought another pair from a local store and compared and the difference is night and day. The real ones from the local store were much softer, smoother. The (I'm assuming fake) Rainbow ones have this small, poorly stamped logo on them was you can see in the photos. I looked all over Rainbow's website and cannot find anything like the sandals we received. Completely ripped off.",0
Too small and I ordered the wrong color.,1
The shoe labeled as black with a picture of a solid black shoe will show up as the Black and White Version. Also these sizes are completely whack. How is a shoe and 8.5 in men's and a 10.5 in women's? Having to return. Whole thing seems sketchy.,1

"First, allow me to say that I adore Skagen watches, their comfort, style and the iconic metal mesh band. I got this as a replacement for another Skagen watch that I made the mistake of taking into the ocean (definitely my fault it died!) So on this new watch, I noted the water resistance, and thought it would be okay to wear it to the gym, (ie that it could deal with the sweat on my wrist, during a cardio workout). Not the case!! It has had condensation on the face for two weeks, despite my not wearing it and putting it in a sack with rice to attempt to dry it out. I am going to see if I can return it, this is not up to the level of quality I expect from Skagen products. I don't know if its a bad model or if its a problem with my particular watch, but clearly the water seal is inadequate and not on par with the product description.",1

"Ordered this Superman costume for my 7 yr. old. It took forever to get here, coming directly from China, by the address on the package. When the costumed finally arrived, it was NOT the costume in the picture. Instead of a nice big, Superman *S* on the front, it has a much small, similarly shaped piece in the middle of the chest that says *Super Hero*.When my husband assisted my son in trying it on for size, the size was fine but several seems split wide open. I sew and I know poor sewing when I see it. I understand that these types of costumes are thin and flimsy, and not constructed well in general, but for a nearly $20 item, my son can't even wear it again until I repair the waist and shoulders that came out. It *might* have enough wear in it to get him through Trick or Treating before it falls apart. We will be throwing it away after that. Don't buy this item!

I was replacing some pairs (of the same style/size/color) that I bought direct from levis when one pair I owned ripped and another became bleach stained after years of use. The Wanderer was giant and the Soft Black was too small (I ordered them both in the same size)... These are either defective (factory defect) or fake/imitation. I ended up keeping them because I didn't realize right away/figured I was imagining, but after a while, it was clear there was something wrong with both pair/they didn't fit the same as the ones that I purchased in the past.

"I did not received the product I expected and it was poorly made. First, the description indicates that it is sheep skin and my expectation (and the picture) indicate that it is constructed of shearling. However, the shoes were lined in fake fur, less puffy than in the photo. Second, I had the same issue mentioned by several people in the reviews that the foot padding was high or uneven and caused their feet to slide to the side. However, in my case the right foot fit perfectly and the left had the issue and caused my foot to slip off to the left (I twisted my ankle slightly while trying to walk on them). Needless to say, I don't have this issue with other shoes or slippers. It was clear that the memory foam lining was poorly cut on one show and there was no padding on the outside of the shoe. So basically cheap and poorly made slippers, with no quality control -- especially for the price.",0

This one has a weird coating on the inside of the material that is peeling off. You can see it on the outside. It also is a color I don't think fjallraven even makes. Fog should be gray. Not blue. I didn't realize it was a fake until months after my purchase, meaning it was way too late to return.Luckily it's still holding up and I use it a lot- just beware of heavily discounted bags. They are cheap for a reason!",0

I don't know whether I should return it, or keep it for when I'm pregnant.

My friend who has an original pair examined my pair and she believes it is counterfeit. Firstly, because the Timberland logo is not equally spaced compared my friend's pair. Secondly, the tips of the laces are meant to be burnt, not plastic. Thirdly, the most obvious is that it should be in the original Timberlands box. WHY WOULD YOU SEND BOOTS IN DIFFERENT BOX?! THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE COUNTERFEITS.For sizing reference, I am a size 8 in women's Converse. A size 6 M fit me nice and snug with a bit of room to move my toes.",0

I was super excited to get this hat but was very disappointed when it arrived. Got the cheap fake I was worried about when reading reviews! Thought I saw enough positive reviews that I was safe but maybe they were old reviews. I know it's the cheap fake because 2 coworkers have this hat (bought from different vendors) and theirs have a Condor tag on it and it says Condor all along the inside seams. This has nothing. Returning.,0
"Well, I'm surprised. I ordered the 49 mm pair before I ordered the 51 mm pair, and they were perfect, just too small. The 49 mm pair were definitely authentic, no problems there. I exchanged them, and when the 51 mm pair arrived, I immediately had my doubts if they were real or not. Everything that was supposed to be there was - each nose pad had a tiny RB on them, everything was spelled correctly, and the left lens had a very small engraved RB on it. However, the glasses didn't seem quite right. There were a lot of tiny things wrong that made me suspect they were fake. The label on the nose bridge was misaligned, the engraving on the lens was extremely faint (much more so than on the 49 mm pair), there was excess glue around one of the hinges and around a fixture, and they came with one of the nose-pad struts badly bent. The box was also missing the correct label and bar-code and felt very cheap. I eventually took them to an authorized Ray Ban dealer, and they were very unsure if they were authentic, initially outright calling them fake. Although they never gave me a concrete yes or no answer, they refused to call them real.I am personally convinced that they are fake and I am returning them. I bought both pairs from Amazon itself, and I am very disappointed that Amazon would sell a fake item and claim that it is real. Although it is possible to get an authentic pair, just know that you are taking a gamble!",0

"These were my first pair of Converse. I'm going to have to assume these are not reflective of the brand overall because uh, these were among the more uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life. They seemed to fit as expected. Roomy in the toe, not at all difficult to get on, expectedly snug around the ankle. But I found it was more comfortable to stand on my hard wood floor in SOCKS than it was to stand around in these shoes.I'm not entirely sure whose idea it was to put a hard layer of stitching right on the back of the ankle, but THIS IS THE WORST THING. My first time wearing them I walked to dinner and back in them - no more than an hour round trip - and on the way back I could barely walk right because the shoes had already torn the skin off the backs of my ankles. Through my socks. I have of course had to wear in shoes before, but you can't wear in something you're afraid to put on again.They do look good. It's a classic sneaker look. But there are plenty of other shoes that look good and feel better.",1

"Bought it larger than needed for room to grow, and it was kind of snug on sides already upon arrival. I had done research and they said to buy big and that is what I did.  Shoe broke apart at the sole within 2 months. Now, I am not sure what the case is, whether it is where Nike bought out the brand back in 2012 and quality suffered or maybe I just got a bad pair, but I don't think these are the Cons we are used to.Granddaughter loves the look, but they fell apart so quickly, not sure how to proceed really.",1

Did not fit like my other Nike shoes in the exact same size.  Also one of the shoes had laces that were several inches shorter than the other.  I suspect these might be fakes.,0

"This is definitely a scam. Very very very very good fakes. I paid attention to every little detail and it even fooled some people that work at a sunglass store. But I got a second and third opinion and they were surprised by what good of fakes these were. First of all the clear coat over the back of the arms that rests on your ears is a different shape from the real Ray-Bans. Look it up online to identify what I am talking about. The plastic part goes out to the right a little too much. Also, the etched RB that this company claims to have on the sunglasses is not etched correctly. Go to any store and compare them and you will see that the RB is eched on the inside of the lens not on the outside of the lens. You shouldn't even be able to feel it if they are real. We paid close attention to the shade of the blue and it is different from the real RayBans. The gold frame is lighter than the real pair and the writing on the side should have a space between the RB and the 3025. It should not read RB3025 which this fake pair does. Real Ray Bans have a different font and are more legible because it is written bigger and the code should read RB 3025 with a SPACE between. Very minor things to look out for. Don't let them get passed you. Pay close attention to the details because they're very hard to notice. They really have a lot of people fooled. The employees and I dissected these sunglasses and the shape of the lens is also very slightly different. Also, in department stores like Nordstrom and all the other places that sell the real product you shouldn't receive a fake tag. Normally it just comes in the box and the box has a bar code label attached on the side of the silver RayBan box. On this package, it is sealed very well on bubble wrap and labeled with a bar code over the bubble wrap instead and the label is most definitely not made by RayBan. Just so everyone is aware you can pay a small fee to get those made to make your business look legitimate. Also, they're so slick that they also customized a sticker to fake their authenticity because things like that fool a lot of people. The sticker reads that if the box or sticker appears unopened, it is because the package was opened during shipment. Trying, of course, to impersonate a legitimate and trustworthy business and trying make it seem like they're looking out, but really if they were then they would have delivered the real deal. This is not a reliable company at all and it's actually a huge deal because they are claiming to be something they are not. Last but not least, the one thing that got me up to go check a second and third time is on the clear part that sits over the nose the RB logo is not supposed to be the same on both nose pieces. One is supposed to be upside down and the other is supposed to sit forward so that it is legible. It's just something that you have to pay attention to because RayBans rarely have manufacture issues. These are definitely definitely definitely fake. Very good ones. But still fake. Stay far away from these sellers. They're nothing but a scam. Wonder if they know it's illegal? ? ?",0

"First of all, I have to clarify I am not giving 1 stars to the watch because I think is bad, on the contrary I think it is a worthy purchase. But as a customer I feel kind of unhappy with the fact that the picture attached with the product description it is not exactly what you receive (at least in my case).Let me clarify this again, the watch is awesome. I love the colors, how the band is soft on the inside but it has a nice texture outside. At first glance it might seem like the band material looks kinda cheap but I assure you is very strong and durable. Also, when you get your watch you do not have to change the band even though it looks wide, it is adjustable, I took it to a local jewelry store and they did the adjustments for free (again, at least in my case).Now, this is where my disappointment lies, when I received the watch I noticed: (1) it did not have a  second hand, while in the image of the product it does, (2) it has only a crown, while in the image you can clearly see a crown and two buttons, (3) the sub-dials are not the same I've got (day, date and small seconds) while the watch in the image (60 seconds, 60 minute and 24 hours) along with the date.This only means that the watch I received does not work as a chronograph, which is ironic considering the word ""chronograph"" is clearly written in the name and description of the product. Such a shame!The only hope that I have left, is that the item I've received is the real deal and not a fake invicta watch.I could say, ""please verify who do you purchase from"", but the store that I bought the item from has a 99% rating right here on Amazon.

"I actually laughed out loud when I opened the box.  The box is more valuable than the broom--great box for packaging some other item in the future--or for the return of this thing.  This is not a very good broom--more like a stick with about 10 bristles on it.  No self-respecting witch could travel anywhere with this thing.  Not enough bristles to sweep up anything except maybe invisible pixie dust....  Don't waste your money...unless you want to pay 9 bucks for a stick.  Go out into your backyard and find one for free, add some other twigs, use some duct tape to fasten them and you'll have  a MUCH better broom for riding , sweeping, or displaying.",1

I've spent tons of money buying replacement pairs after these pantyhose did not hold up even for a single day. I just put a pair on this morning straight out of the package and by 9:30 a.m. I felt them run while sitting at my desk without even snagging them on anything.

Too big. Look fake. I should have known 1 carat would look super big.,0
"I was looking forward to these shoes due to the crazy-good reviews, but I'm not happy with them. For a slip-on shoe, it's not quite tight enough (especially for a new shoe) around the opening, and the arch support is awkward. The length of the shoe was a perfect fit, but the arch support felt  misplaced (either too much support or the support was at an awkward angle). I knew I'd have a lot of foot pain if I decided to keep them instead of sending them back.",1
"While the description says ""leather uppers"", the box says: Birko-Flor.  What's that you ask? Birko-Flor is Bikernstock for ""acrylic and polyamide...that looks and feels like velvety nubuck"".

By the time he washed his hands with it on the paint started coming off, and the ring appearance started changing a lot.

"Awful! Super hard and uncomfortable. The Velcro closure is not stretchy or adjustable. It was weirdly tight and loose at the same time. How does that even happen!? The actual shoe was tight, but because the Velcro was not adjustable it felt as the shoes would fall off. My shoe size is between a 7.5 and 8. I ordered the 8 wide. I did this because I planned on using these for work. When you're on your feet all day they can get swollen. I figured the wide would let my feet ""breathe"". The tongue of the shoe was weird too. It was barely sewed on and flopped around. The insole was not cushy...thin and cheap. The sole was hard and plastic feeling. I don't understand how the reviews are so good. It was the reason I bought them. I know fake reviews are a thing, but this has over 500. The only good thing about this is amazon is so good about returns.",0

Amazon is taking the side of the vendor when allowing this and other dishonest sales tactics to take place.  Not just in this instance either.  Singer sewing machine's have fake ratings and reviews.  Is it worth the extra buck per customer?  I'm more and more disappointed in my so called ""prime"" membership.",0
"To preface my review, it does not appear that I received the correct Hanes socks (I've attached a picture). I have owned the socks pictured in the product description before; those socks were well-stitched and high quality (You can tell they're not the same socks by the white stitching vs the red stitching in the product picture). In my opinion, these socks do not appear to be well-stitched (they also seem to run smaller in size vs the other ones). Additionally, even after washing them several times, the socks still shed a lot of material when you take them off; I do not anticipate these socks lasting very long and am very disappointed.",1

I didn't really care, as I knew the color I got was hard to find. However, after barely a year of daily use, this thing is falling apart. Loose strings, iffy zipper, color faded. It's not like I'm carrying 100 lbs in it either, just a planner, a diabetic test kit, a cosmetic bag and my U-Lock. I'm almost wondering if I got a fake because I heard these bags are supposed to last forever and mine was trashed after about two months of use. :( Two starts only because it's pretty cute, otherwise, save your money.",0

"dry ground, dirt trail or rock hopping - this shoe is fantastic.  great fit, great traction, great everything.wet surface- disaster.  when I stepped into the river bed and stepped onto a wet rock, I almost slipped and could have had a disaster if i had fallen.  The rock itself was not slippery for other people and did not have any slippery surface (such as moss); it was just wet.  So for the rest of the hike, i had to be extremely careful, which reduced the fun I was looking forward to, on my rappelling vacation in Costa Rica.  It was as if the bottom of my sandal was sprayed with Teflon.  Whenever I returned to dry ground and the shoe bottom dried in about 30 seconds, I then had great traction again.  Step on a wet rock and the slippery Teflon bottom resumed.  Weird.  I have always liked TEVA, but their quality control and field testing is evidently no longer part of their process.TEVA - i recommend you market this shoe as a hiking shoe only, and remove the words ""Water Adventures including: Sit on top kayaking, River Rafting, Canoeing, Amphibious Hiking"" from your product description",1

The gloves I got are nothing like on the picture advertised, and I agree with other reviewers who rated it low. They came in a clear plastic bag, could suit a boy or a girl for any purpose. Hey, Disguise people, who don't you advertise them as a ""multi-purpose child gloves""? and by the way, the company won't exchange the item, I can only return for a refund. Isn't it telling of their morals? So disappointed!",1
I took it out of the box and tried it on I couldn't even move my head without the fold down piece falling down or completely off. It is EXTREMELY uncomfortable and the space to see out of is way too small. It looks okay on a shelf but that's about it. WouldNot recommend.,1
This helmet isn't that great. My biggest issue is with the rubber hair on top and the really thin cheap strands they attached to come down the back. All in all it just looks very cheap and fake when you see it in person.,0

I ordered these on Friday Feb. 10th. and got suckered into subscribing to Amazon Prime with the expectation of having 2 Day delivery.(I wanted these by Feb. 14th)So my Fiance was waiting by the door like a puppy for a week! Finally got these Sh***y diamonds on Feb. 17th. Now my expectations were not too high considering the price. But, I was hoping they would at least look like eachother. One was noticeably bigger and cloudy,with what appears to be black sand throughout. The other was smaller ,more yellow with a big piece of ""black sand"" toward the bottom. These do not shine at all! I wouldn""t let my dog wear these! Not even worth the box they came in! I'll be sending these back,cancelling my Prime account,and visiting Overstock a little more! Amazon you suck!",0

"So I really needed new jeans and I always buy Levi's 510s because they fit perfectly and look good (I am very skinny.) I ordered the ""Rigid Dragon"" color from here because it was a better deal than in stores and I have Prime. Size 30x30.I got them in the mail and they fit TERRIBLY. Way too baggy and felt really cheap. They were definitely not the Levi's quality I was used it and a disappointment. I've ordered 510 jeans from multiple places online (Levis.com, ebay, etc.) and they always fit the same. But these ones look awful.So I was hopeful and gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt. Instead of returning them I exchanged them for the Jet black colored 510s. Now, I literally already have a pair of the exact same jeans right now, but the knees ripped. The exact same. I received my new ones from Amazon and same thing, NOT skinny fit and NOT the same jeans. I even layed them on top to compare the sizes and it's way off! What in the world? Look at the pictures in Customer Images for reference.I don't know if Amazon is selling fake Levis, if Levis just happened to change their jeans completely recently (not likely), or these are just outlet type sales, but these are NOT the 510s I was hoping for.Big letdown, 1 star. I'm literally never buying jeans from Amazon again, and will tell others to stay away from their clothing department.

"I thought that since it ""claims"" to have a waterproof layer that prevents leakage and has a super absorbent layer to absorb wetness that my daughter would be safe wearing just that swim diaper while she waited to go swimming so I could put sunblock on her.  Here is what the incorrect claim reads on the product description that you should be made aware of:-Waterproof layer prevents leakage-Super absorbent layer absorbs wetnessShe must have had it on for only a few minutes and peed because there was pee all over her and all over my lap.  This diaper looked great and like another reviewer said, ""It seemed to have been made real well""--but it totally did not do what it claimed to do--you'd think if it had super absorbency then it would hold pee for a minute, right?!  Since this is my first child, I guess you live and learn.",1

Also, the bottoms on these new flip flops are peeling off.  There are little pieces left everywhere.  I noticed it after only the second time I wore them.

With great anticipation I carefully brought the package in out of the rain, gathered my sharpest key, opened the box, and was immediately disappointed.

I knew from the other reviews this was going to be cheaply made and it really is.  I just didn't know what other alternative there was to complete my 3 year-old's tin man costume.  I'm leaving it in the package until we need it so there are no chances of it breaking beforehand.,1

They were soft but like reviewers before they had a ""made in china"" tag. I don't think that's correct for real UGG shoes? I could be wrong... The sole of the shoe just completely came out when I was feeling things out for authenticity. The stitching was sloppy. The UGG logo in the back is oversized. (All pics/examples displayed on UGG website to identify real vs. fake) It had a QR code but after 30 or so minutes I couldn't get it to scan worth a crap so I said screw it. UGG website over-nighted me the same pair for free at the same price and I know for a fact they are 100% authentic. You can't beat that so I returned these.

The one I got is completely different. It's a crappy fake leather on the inside instead of the nice, smooth cloth. Also, it's not a braided clasp, it's also fake leather. The cards don't slide in and out easily at all! I want my money back!",0

"Very disappointed!  I ordered two pair.  Good thing, too, because the first pair ripped before I pulled up the first leg.

"Buyer beware! The product description for these jeans, in dark quartz, says 100% cotton. The product I received is NOT 100% cotton - it is 90% cotton, 10% polyester. I have bought Lee jeans for many years, and they have always been 100% cotton denim, with a good fit. The product I received feels different from past Lee jeans, and the fit is smaller than in the past. The product number on the tag is correct, so it's not an instance of Amazon shipping the wrong product. I am very disappointed with this product.",1
"Horrible! I've been wearing Sperry Top-Siders for years and these are so dreadful in quality I suspect they are fake. They creased deeply upon the first wearing, the leather seemed faux, and after wearing them only three times they split at the seams! This is shocking considering I own pairs of Top-Siders that are half a decade old and still look practically new. I have no way of complaining about my order either. Don't buy these. Go to a reputable seller and buy the authentic shoe.",0

"Pretty disappointed with this purchase. I ordered three pairs in different colors, and only one of the three was genuine. The other two were clearly FAKE/COUNTERFEIT/KNOCKOFFS. It may be hard to discern if this was your first pair, and you may just write off Pumas as a crummy brand, but please inspect carefully when you receive them. I've been wearing the Puma Suedes for the past 6-7ish years, and these are the first pairs I've purchased online.The gold print and logo should be sharp with crisp edges, and smooth. Two of my pairs had print that was run together and had a bunch of overspray or whatever you want to call it. The leather is also of a different quality, which may be harder to discern. See the pictures I uploaded with my review. Only the grey pair is genuine, and I think you will see the difference.The sole/underside: Only the genuine pair had a very clearly defined . The other two were poorly cast.The box: If you open your shoebox and it has a sticker that says ycmproducts.com, you very likely have a fake. The fake pairs also came wrapped in tissue paper that says puma. The genuine pair had plain white tissue paper and no sticker. The boxes are nearly identical themselves.I bought three pairs seeing the price drop, and only one was real. I'm returning the other two to Amazon, and using the money to buy one real pair in the store.Buyer beware!",0

"Very disappointed in these shoes. I have a normal foot, yet they are way too loose on the back (heel), and way too tight in the front (toes.) Also the left shoe creaks, loudly, with every step. They are also not very attractive, and feel like badly-fitting slippers.

"I have never reviewed a product but I was really disappointed with the quality of this watch.  I have purchased many Timex watches in the past but this one is cheaply made.  No where on the watch does it say ""Timex"" so I am concerned that this is actually a fake.  I have only had it for a couple of weeks so there aren't any issues with the watch itself.  The straps are cheap plastic and it becomes an issue when I workout.",0
"I was really disappointed when I received this. The color pictured, a rather muted brown, was what I was hoping for. Instead, this thing looks like someone took that dye and mixed a can of day-glo orange in with it. It's heinous. Maybe it was meant for contractors to be able to find it at the bottom of the ocean or in the event of a nuclear war or something, I don't know. The main color doesn't match the trim either.It's a shame too, because I really like the way the thing is made. It's sturdy and the material is heavy without being too stiff. It's comfortable to carry and the pocket layout is very intelligent and spacious. I would carry this thing for years if it was the color pictured.Overall, very disappointed. Would not recommend this, based on the color alone. I wouldn't have given it a second glance at a retail store, except maybe to confirm that the purchaser for that store had lost their mind.",1

Nothing personal against this company but if you want a real Guilligan gob do not buy this one you will be as disapointed as I was. I only paid about $2.00 so for my time and energy its not even worth my returning it, I just sent it to my trash bin. I did not want to give this gob a single star but I cant review it unless I rate it so by default I had to give it 1 star but trust me it doesnt deserve that.",0

Got a pair for Christmas and was defective: the insole was obviously glued in crooked on the left shoe.

"So the one star is not for the product itself but for people to be careful. I ordered the backpack about a month ago to use for school. It seems to be the authentic one, I didn't really check. After a month or so, the bag started fraying and there was discoloration. This is not supposed to happen, so I told Amazon and being Amazon and great customer service, they sent me a replacement. The replacement came and immediately knew it was not real. The logo was too glossy the zippers were not close to the same color as the bag, the place where you put your contact information does not have the company creed and the Fjallraven was not in color. I told Amazon again and they sent me another one (I'm guessing from the same place) and still it had the same characteristics as the first replacement. I gave up and in the process of sending the fakes back.If you look closely at the pictures for the Brick color you can actually see where you place your contact info, that's not how it's supposed to look like. It's not supposed to be black and white and it's not supposed to be in a horizontal rectangular shape but rather a vertical rectangular shape with a little tidbit about the company. The logo is also supposed to be matte with red lettering not glossy with pink lettering.I ended up having to buy it at an actual retailer (Urban Outfitters). So the rest of the review would be about the backpack. The backpack itself is pretty roomy. I don't have a lot of stuff in the first place, but everything fits. Inside there's also a little pocket that a little of people is for your laptop. It will fit a laptop of around 13 inches. But I would not recommend it for that since there's no padding at all. If you want to use it for that, I would recommend getting the one specifically for laptops as they have that. The grey foam is there but that's to keep the backpack's shape and it's also a little seat for when you're hiking and you can't find a good place to sit. The side pockets will not fit standard sized water bottles. I usually clip a couple of pens on there and my keys. The other side I put my phone (iPhone 6). The straps are surprisingly comfortable; they are thin, but they don't dig into my shoulders again I don't have a lot my stuff. The front pocket is big, but not deep. I usually put my keys, a snack, and my headphones in there.Overall I do like the product, I just wished that Amazon would not sell fakes. I've alerted Amazon, but I don't know if anything is being done.",0

"I have loved all CW-X products that I have tried thus far, but this bra totally fails.  The product description leads one to believe that with the encapsulation everything will stay where it is supposed to, but somehow one ends up with a large lump in the middle of the chest.  Super disappointment, especially after the cost.  The band also bunches up to be a thin piece of elastic that ends of pinching and binding.  And all this after originally trying on my proper size, which was too large, and then going with the next smaller size...  The cups appear in the picture to be true cups, but in reality they are quite shallow, which causes the problem.",1

"Well, after reading all the positive reviews I expected something better.. Then again it was only 30 bucks..CONS:- The chain for this pendant is horrible.. It is extremely thin, boxy, and.. upon arrival it will probably have some kinks in the chain.- The necklace is not pinned, bagged, or mounted in the box, so it will shift and tangle upon delivery.- The pendant is larger than expected... It is little larger than a quarter.. if your looking for a small heart.. this is not it.- It looks cheap.. Sure its plated in gold, but with the large pendant and the thin boxy chain makes it look like fake jewelry.PROS:- Only $30- Good concept, but needs improvements.CONCLUSION:The only good thing on our side, is its the thought that counts..Not recommended as a gift for birthdays, anniversaries, or valentines day... (Trust me, your better off increasing your price tag.)I think its a good fit for teens or someone who doesn't want to spend alot on there girlfriend..",0
"Somewhat large? Somewhat small? This is one of the worst ill-fitting, cone-shaped, bras I've ever subjected myself to!  I'm small (4'11"") and somewhat large busted (36DD) and need a comfortable and good fitting underwire bra and believe, me this isn't it!  The support isn't great, the underwires poke and eventually poke through the fabric, the top of the cups bag slightly and don't conform or fit the breast well, the fabric is very uncomfortable, straps tend to slip and yet still somehow manages to dig in and create huge permanent dents in my shoulders. It also looks and feels like you're wearing your grannie's cheap drugstore bra... all you need are granny-pants to complete the look.If you can actually find it, I would highly recommend buying the ""Bali Smooth Compliments Underwire Bra #3100"" instead (Amazon has a few left). IT actually fits like a glove, has great support, the straps don't slip or dig in and, it looks pretty and feels amazing. Unfortunately, Bali has stupidly decided to discontinue it, so if you can actually find one in your size, grab it; but whatever you do avoid the ""Women's Flower Underwire bra #0180"".",1

"I should have heeded the warnings of others.  I didnt.  So, I find myself writing this review to warn any unsuspecting future buyers of this product.  So here it is - These are beautiful to have and to hold; however, they were functionally inadequate.  I purchased the 13E-15E sized trees to give as a present.  When they arrived, I tested them in an available 12E sized shoe.  To my surprise, they were a size or more too small.  Since, I had purchased two pair I thought that it might have simply opened a bad set.  So, I tried the second set and had the same result.  These are beautiful trees; but, there is a problem in manufacturing.  Perhaps these are shoe trees for people with small feet  nothing against that of course.  Never-the-less, the product description is misleading.  The product should be removed from the site until the issue with sizing is corrected.",1

I bought these Koi pants thinking they were the real deal but I am pretty sure these are fakes. These pants are different then the other Koi pants of the same style I have bought at the scrub stores. This pair had two cargo pockets (which real Koi Lindsay pants only have one) and the D ring was in the wrong spot. The fabric also felt thinner. Two stars only because I will wear them but I've made sure to tell all my co-workers not to buy Koi off of Amazon.,0
They are supposed to be 6 to 9 months and they are more like 3 months.  We won't get much use of of them and didn't realize it until after I washed them so can't return them,1

Is this a joke? To spent $50 on a fake converse? Very disappointed. Bought this for a friend as a gift. This was the worst gift ever.,0
These shoes do not match up to the ones we have seen in physical stores. They could either be fake or for some reason this batch does not match up with the ones in stores.,0
"Was very disappointed in this.  The colors of the costume do not match the picture and the hat is absolutely terrible.  Made of foam, gray not black and arrived with large creases that prevent the horns from standing up straight.  The horns are just flat foam, not rounded or stuffed, another thing you cannot tell from the photo in the advertisement.  The costume itself is plenty large for an adult even though it says 12-14.  I normally wear an 18 and it is loose on me.  However there is something very funky about the neck -- it's more like the size of an armhole and my head will not fit through without cutting and stitching.  Overall very disappointed -- most likely the last time a purchase a costume online.",1

"I bought a lovely necklace that Amazon featured this set of earrings as well as a bracelet with as a ""buy together for"" deal.  I was SO incredibly disappointed with these earrings!  These were described as 4-5 mm, and the length 1.75"".  The image alone is deceiving.  The actual ""pearl"" portion is only 1"" long (see images I uploaded).  If the seller had featured a picture of them being worn, I would have seen the pearls & overall earrings were much smaller.  My husband, an engineer, measured the pearls with a caliper and found they were 3 mm at best, only 2 were 4 mm.  The freshwater pearl necklace (from a different seller) looks NOTHING like these earrings and together look mismatched so I gave the earrings to my teenage daughter.  For a 16 year old, these are fine, but I wouldn't rate these earrings better than any fake set you could buy at Claire's.  I think I'm done purchasing jewelry on Amazon.com unless they start requiring sellers to post more images, especially of the item worn.",0

"I like retro digital watches and even though I have much more expensive watches, I like wearing basic, cheap models. Therefore, I thought this Timex would be a nice addition to my collection. I have some Casio retro digitals and I also have several Timex Ironman models, all of which are nice. But this watch was atrocious. The first thing I noticed removing it from the box was that the LCD display was significantly out of alignment with the case. I guess I'm kind of anal about that, but it immediately made me want to return the watch, on that flaw alone. But there was more. The band was pretty flimsy feeling, unlike the Casio counterpart, which has a much sturdier and nicer looking band. Furthermore, the band was borderline too small. My wrists are medium and this band claimed to be large and should fit with plenty of room, but it didn't. And lastly, the product description claims this model has a chrono, alarm and a timer, but it does not have a timer. At least the version I received did not. Maybe they sent a similar model, but not the exact one. In any case, all these flaws made returning it an easy decision. I'm sticking with the nicer, cheaper and tougher Casio version (Casio Men's A178WA-1A), which is only $13.99. Anyway, maybe the one I got was a factory dud, but bottom line is I'd pass on this one.",1
It is flimsy cheap plastic and is not solid.  There should be a description of the item on Amazon so people know what they are getting.  The clock doesn't work and the heart isn't solid.,1

This costume was bought for my 3 year old for Halloween. I had to return it because it was way too small and the quality was cheap and not at all as pictured.

"Cheap, strange texture, and a waste of money. I bought these pantyhose in black and within 4 hours of wearing them (and careful care of them while I was wearing them), I had a giant snag up my entire thigh and another snag on my right calf. I was wearing these with a dress so I have no idea what could have even caused the snag up my thigh. In black, these have a very odd texture making your legs, and especially your ankles, look wrinkled. I should've just gotten the $5 pantyhose from the grocery store rather than wasting $10 on these. These were in the garbage before my night was over.",1
"These are fake Levis. The tags don't say Levi Strauss anywhere; the area is just left blank. I don't mind buying dupes as long as I actually am aware that I'm buying dupes before purchasing. However, I'm not willing to pay full retail price for a fake. This review is for the Wanderer wash.",0

Don't be deceived. This is not a genuine Levi product. Does not have genuine stamp on inside. Very disappointed with this item. It was not what it was discribed to be.

"I purchase watches with full metal cases because I am hard on them. The product description says it has a stainless steel case. This is misleading. The bulk of the case is plastic with a thin layer of metal over the plastic. Not a plating, but a thin metal case with the plastic case on the inside. Also there seemed to be a large amount of plastic and rubber involved with the watch band to case connection. The watch only weighs a few ounces, but is on the large size giving the impression of a very cheap watch. The kind you get for free when you order something from a catalog. This watch might survive a white collar lifestyle, but anyone that works with his hands would destroy this in weeks or shorter.As for the timepiece itself, it is legible, but I only had it for a few minutes before arranging for its return, so I have no idea how accurate it is.",1
"The moment I put them on, a huge run appeared from my thigh to my ankle.  This is ridiculous.",1
"So I was excited to receive these as a throwback to high school days. Much to my dismay, I ordered the wrong size because they are men's sizing NOT women's. No way to tell in the description or anything until I received them.  I just wish that they weren't listed under Women's shoes since they are men's sizing, or just make it absolutely apparent that they are sized in Men's sizes instead of women's.",1
"I just received this supposed ""authentic"" watch from this seller. When I opened the box the watch was covered in plastic. Never have I bought a watch that had a plastic wrapped band; besides from watches I have purchased when over seas that were replicas. I then looked more closely at the watch to find it was covered in defects. There was wear  and tear all over the watch around the bezel and watch case. The case back which read ""stainless steel"" already had rust under the plastic coating and some kind of black material which may have seeped out from resealing the case back. Most of the ""swarovski crystals"" were also not set correctly and they were off center. In the product description it reads that the band is stainless steel, which I find hard to believe with the weight of the watch. The one thing that completely gave it away was that on the bezel of the watch it is supposed to have a triangle design at the 12 and 6 o'clock marks. THIS WATCH DOES NOT. NO WAY IT IS REAL. I'm going to contact Bulova about this and find out if any watches in this style were made with a different bezel than what they show on their website. I then called amazon and told them about the situation and placed an order for a watch from a different seller in hopes that the watch will be authentic and undamaged on arrival. The customer representative from amazon did waive the fee for one day shipping however the new shipment will not arrive before Christmas!! THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHRISTMAS GIFT.... Very disappointed with seller and amazon about this. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS SELLER.",1

A couple of hrs into wearing them, the leg hem started rolling up my thighs, creating once again embarrassing bulges.

"So I deleted my previous review, written in the heat of the moment of my great disappointment. It was true, but a bit harsh.  If buying these jeans you should definitely pay more attention to the hip size in the sizing chart than the waist size since these are a low rise style. Also, when they arrived they were plastered with stickers stating that they were  designed as ""Relaxed Fit"". They are definitely of this genre and I would have taken this into account when ordering had this fact not merited but a vague bullet point in the product description.  ""Relaxed Fit"" should definitely be in the bold title as it normally is when jeans are cut this way.  Long story short, I am 5' 7"" tall, my waist is 29"" and my hips are 36"".  I ordered a size 8 and they are pull up pants since I don't need to unbutton or unzip them to put them on or take them off. I also need to belt them since otherwise they would be around my ankles all the time.  Probably a size 6 would have fit, but I'm not going to find out, so good luck.  Vanity sizing is what kept me in the illusion that I was a size 10 for many years when I was more like a real size 14.  It's not doing anyone any favors.",1

My son loves chucks so I wanted to get him another pair because he grew out of his first grey pair. I received this pair of shoes and one of the shoes looked as if a whole group of kids tried on the shoe and then they shipped it out. I was very upset because they were for Christmas. Will not buy from this seller again.,0

"I read the reviews, so I was aware that the costume ran small. I thought that it would be okay for my husband because he is only 5'3"" and weighs 135 lbs. This costume still did not really fit him. He had to buy supportive pants for underneath or it was going to be a bit embarrassing for him. I also altered it to loosen the crotch area. We managed to make it work, but he wasn't as comfortable as I would have liked. It's a shame that it is so ill fitting because it is the most accurate costume that I could find. This costume can not be intended for any adult male. It is a child's size.",1
These ripped in about an hour.I put these on and within the hour there was a rip in the heel.I won't buy these again.I got exactly ONE wearing out of these for $8,1

It was a 4 pk, so I was able to wear to grab the second and third ones, but then the second time I wore them, another one tore. A third one tore about the fourth or fifth time I wore them. So, I'm left with just one perfectly colored one. I was hoping to have some easy to put on nylons for when I need to look dress up a little more for a short period of time and don't want to go through the hassle of putting on pantyhose.",1
Broom arrived damaged.  The entire side of the broomstick had a crack down the length of it.  Very cheaply made.  The bottom of the broom is also very sparse.  We are returning it.,0

I knew this would be small but it was only $7.63 so I didn't expect much. When I pulled the broom out of the box I got a splinter from the bristles. While I was looking at it the bristles started falling out of the bundle they were tied in. Even if it didn't fall apart as soon as I removed it from the box the bristles were so thin it looked silly.  I just tossed it and will keep looking for or make a better broom to use for my costume.,1

"Steer clear. I am so disappointed in this product. I've purchase this Hanes brand and style before at Target many times and was happy with them as a good solid work hose and thrilled to find it on Amazon prime. But something has changed in the past year and Hanes quality has deteriorated.  I've purchased them on Amazon and at Target and they fall apart within an hour. I bought the same size and brand but color, stretch, sheerness and durability are awful.  I used to purchase the Buff Beige color, which was a good neutral color for lightly tanned Caucasian legs.  That color has been discontinued.  The Nude color us either too white or too thick (not sheer!) and Barely There is a fake orange.  Bad enough but they now sag and tear.  The package said run resistant but instead they developed gaping holes in the heel and where the crotch is sewn.  Omg what a day at work I had.  Check out the photos for a visual - I couldn't believe this happened to a pair I wore in just one morning.",1

I was under the impression that I was purchasing authentic Ray Ban shades until they cracked. While trying to replace the lens I found out they are fake. They are probably the closest replica Ive seen but it angers me that I paid exactly what real Ray Ban shades cost.,0

The inside lining is removable on these where the original UGGs weren't.  Pieces of the inside kept coming out and the fit is not the same.  These are either fake or the company is making them with much lower quality standards.  Also note these are made in China not Austria.,0

"So I've been wearing Levi's for years. Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to find the 529 in stores now as the company changed their line a couple years ago. I was happy when I found them here! I got the Glacier colored ones in my size and they fit as expected, albeit a tad long for the regular length. But it's not too bad.Now this where I believe these are fakes (or a bad batch)...I got them in October last year and as instructed I did wash them first before wearing. Fast forward to seven months later ... am still destroying light colored furniture because the color bleeds. I've stopped carrying light bags when I wear these jeans because the color WILL transfer on them. And it's not just a little bit of color either! Generally, jeans will not transfer color after a couple washes. Not these ones! I've never had a pair of Levi's that did that. And I've got them from black to darkest blue.Beware of this issue. I'm not going to buying them from here again. I walked into JC Penney a month ago and it seems they keep a limited supply of the 529s. Got a pair a month ago and haven't had this problem. I'm going to be donating this pair. Even though it didn't work for me it will help someone else.",0

These are fake and if your okay with that, please don't break them because you cannot get them fixed.",0
"I have to say I was disappointed with this purchase.  First of all, the product came to me in the mail smashed.  I was able to pop the heart back into shape, but the plastic was marked from being smashed. Secondly, there was no back to the heart.  It is not a full hollow plastic heart as it appears to be.  From the front it looks great.  From the back, it's just the white shell of the front piece.  The chain was very flimsy.  I was mostly disappointed that it wasn't packaged properly and came smashed.",0

"If the price of something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Such is the case here. Private Island says these are $20 EarPro ear warmers marked down to the incredibly low price of just $1.05. I feel sorry for anyone who has paid $20, or $10, or even $5. These are $1-$2 ear warmers. They should consider using the word ""disposable"" in the product description, as this would be more accurate. If the build quality was any lower, they would be useless. Perhaps this would be ideal for someone who is always losing their warmers and needed a box full of cheap facsimiles available to simply reach in and pull out a new set every time the need arose, but that's not what I was looking for, so these are going back.Update 01-28-10: I've noticed the price of these fluctuates day-to-day between $1 and $8.",1

"Hate is not a reflection of the quality of the shoe - more a description of the level of frustration in trying to get a pair that fits. I have now placed two different orders for this shoe in the last two weeks. The first order resulted in a pair of D width shoes which simply do not fit me ( as I well know ! ).The second order resulted in a 50% improvement - one shoe was indeed the 2E width that I had ordered but one shoe was still a D width. I finally called and talked with a very sympathetic customer service rep who offered to send me the third pair overnight ( as I am leaving for vacation in two days ). However, once I placed the order, she could not override the system to get the earlier delivery date (she was not sure why).So, after vacation, I will try to order another pair - one can only hope for eventual success. This is the first problem I have had with Amazon Prime over at least a ten year period.",0

Within weeks the straps started to crack and fall apart due to poor quality fake leather. I ended up using duct tape to hold the straps together .

In the past Bali has been a very comfortable and friendly brand to me, but this particular make and model is apparently off and made for women who are wearing high-collared outfits only.  As a side note, I'd hoped the clear mesh would be sexy and instead it's very matronly and adds to the over all terrible look and feel of the bra.",1

Maybe they are import from a different country where the specifications and materials are not the same. I think Amazon would not sell fakes, so I guess it is rather the latter.Differences I could notice (see also pictures)1) Material not the same2) Pocket shape not the same (the USA ones can fit well an iPhone Plus, the Amazon ones not)3) They don't have the Levi's tags you usually find on the ones you purchase in the department stores4) The colors & material of buttons and rivets is not same5) The writing on the Levi's label not the same colorI am returning them. The main complain I have is about the pocket shape that makes uncomfortable sitting with iPhone Plus I the pocket.Beside this you can feel that they they are different and also less comfortable to wearThe Amazon price of this item is similar as from big USA department stores, so I am disappointed to get some less good fake or less good import stuff",0

"I don't normally write reviews but I thought I would share that I also received fake boots. I had wanted these boots forever and should have known by the deal I was getting . I ended up paying $80 for a $130 pair of boots. I bought them in February but after months of wondering why they were so uncomfortable and wearing out so fast I started to do a little research. I looked at the fellow reviews on here and noticed someone else had received fake boots. Mine met her description. Mine say ""made in Mexico"" on the inside and ""SINETHIC"" instead on synthetic. I have looked at the boots in the Steve Madden store at the mall and they say ""made in brazil"" and synthetic is spelled correctly. I'm not sure if all pairs that amazon is selling are fake, but I know that I got a ""good deal"" and these are fake!",0

I checked the product description to see if I missed something and the description is for underwear not the shirts. Lesson learned.,1
These Oakleys aren't legit. They are not an official Oakley product.

After reviewing them, I have to question whether or not they are truly effective against MRSA as the product description claims. Furthermore, the picture used for the product is not even close to what the product actually looks like. How can I be sure it's safe to be used on my shoes or where my feet will go? The description on the can makes no mention of being used on shoes. Finally, the product description conveniently leaves out the warning from the State of California that chemicals in the product may cause cancer.",1

I don't have time to send this back and wait for a new one so I'm going to fix it myself.  The costume will do the job for this year but I doubt it'll last longer than this weekend.

"I had this on my wishlist and received it as a Christmas gift (bought from Amazon). I have had Buxton wallets for years and years and this one was to be a replacement for the Cardex style I currently had (as I had not searched long enough to find the single cardex available too). One of the reasons this type wallet had always appealed to me was the double currency compartments. I have always kept my receipts in one area and my currency in the other. This wallet is advertised as having two compartments for bills but I was sorely disappointed that the red one I received only had one. The double compartment was the primary reason I wanted this wallet. I am also not sure it is leather as past Buxton wallets have always had it stamped on the leather somewhere. This one does not. Certainly the inside is plastic and it 'crackles' every time I open it. I am very unhappy with this wallet and the poor quality it seems Buxton has sunk to.  Had it not been a gift I would definitely return it.Update: I finally got around to moving what I had in my old wallet to this new one. TERRIBLE! I only have a few cards and pictures I carry and even though it was not full, I could barely snap the wallet closed. When I put the coins in the coin holder the coin compartment would not stay closed. I took all but one coin out and it STILL would pop open when I snapped it. I certainly will not buy another Buxton wallet if this is the ""quality"" they are proud of now. Even being a gift, it is going to be returned.",1

"When the price looks too good to be true it probably is. Mine were very high quality fakes ordered from the seller ""Sunbathing"" at around half MSRP. I ordered the tortoise frames with green polarized lenses. Everything about them was identical to the real thing except the lens angle was not right. The 2140s should have a drastic angle where the arms meet the front of the frame. Mine had close to a 90 degree angle. I even took them to Sunglass Hut and compared them to the same model 2140, angle was not right at all. However, some people who prefer the straighter angle may be satisfied with these, especially since they are significantly cheaper than retail price. Another giveaway was the printing quality in the booklets they come with. The images were terribly pixelated, looked similar to if I tried to print it on my home printer. They're good quality, but still fake. I'd rather have the real things.",0
"This watch worked very well.. at least for 12 hours. Every time it hit 6:04 am/pm it would stop ticking. I took it to a watch shop given that something was mechanically flawed; I was told the price of the repair would be more than the watch itself.  As a final thought, I wound the watch over 20 times hoping it would perhaps power it. The next day I boxed it up and dropped it off at a UPS drop box. I was refunded the price and shipping within four hours.The watch looks good and feels very light. I would almost say for $70 it was quality considering I doubt all Sturhlings stop at 6:04 twice a day. The strap, like many suggested is fake and feels/looks cheap. The packaging is surprisingly good; Amazon box over a shell over the watch case shows they have pride in their product.I would not say this is a bad watch, merely I had a poor experience/flawed product. I would say that you will be taking a gamble when you buy a Stuhrling Classic Ascot.",0

"Cheap. Plastic. There is a front and back that fits together with Velcro. It's huge, and nearly impossible to look down without the eye-holes drifting out of your gaze. It is made of cheap plastic, but I don't know what I expected for $30. Someone has to pay Disney and by proxy George Lucas for the 4Billion USD. I would have given it 2 stars except it arrived dirty, scuffed and dented. It looks like someone used it once for Halloween and returned it. Then the seller repackaged it and sold it to me. Garbage that my kids recognize as STAR WARS, but any sort of collector would vomit. Look elsewhere. And spend the money. I wish I had read my own review before I purchased this item.",1

"I wanted SO HARD to like this boot. If you've got good boots, they'll give you wonderful ankle support, something that most shoes on the market don't do for me.Pros:- canvas upper & leather upper stitched well together - good for hot weather- speed laces make for faster boot tying- ripple sole is designed for hard surfaces - very good support- side vents to allow your feet to dry fasterCons:- I hoped I could have avoided this one. I even ordered from Rothco, fearing other people's reviews here on Amazon about fakes from China. Well, MINE WAS MADE IN CHINA. First red flag.- I hadn't been wearing these boots for a month before the sole SPLIT IN HALF. Yep, that's right, the stupid inferior rubber & the foam sole split right where you would kneel. It just started raining again here in Northern California, so the thick sole that would have avoided the water soaks it right up in that big fat crack.- Two months after buying these, the leather uppers have cracks in them as well.Bottom line:Like my title says, a good design undermined by inferior materials.

If you've never felt real Ray Bans before, and just want to wear the glasses for the brand name, then these may be the ticket.  After all, they're significantly cheaper.

"I really don't like the latest trend to huge watches. I don't wear a watch for fashion, but I like to wear something nice that will last.I really like the look of a Rolex Submariner, and I even considered a replica (fake) Rolex for a while, but I'm really not a fake rolex kinda guy. Then I saw these, which I admit look a lot like the Rolex, but they are not replicas, or fakes. They are genuine Invictas.The watch looks great. It's a nice size and not too heavy. I've had it a week and I'm very happy with it. IF you are real stickler for details, note that the second hand doesn't always line up exactly with the minute lines on the dial face. And one morning, I found the date number only half way advanced between a 09 and a 10. I just tapped the side of the case and it went to the correct display.I give it a 5 based on the fact that it's a $58 watch, and I think it delivers a real bargain at that price.UPDATE November 2014: Might take one star away due to two things - one of the strap pins broke and the watch fell right off my wrist. Thankfully, on to a carpet rather than into the water. Also, sometimes it seems that the day/date gets confused, or doesn't change at midnight. Still, a nice watch for the price.UPDATE MARCH 2016: Now taking away three stars. The watch band broke again, and the watch fell on the floor. The hands all came loose, so they just flopped around. Invicta has a 5 year warranty, but they want $28.00 shipping. That is more than half the price I paid originally ($58), so I'll pass on that. Invicta watches are just too cheaply made. And, I didn't wear it every day. It really had little use. Compare that with the $15 plastic Casio I have that has endured 4 seasons in Antarctica, and still works perfectly.At this point, I have to revise my rating to two stars.",0

The left sneaker is not normal - there is an area that protrudes slightly, but abnormally, where the ball of the foot makes contact. I've worn shopping mall purchased Chuck Taylors for MANY years and find them very comfortable. In fact, I currently have a pair purchased in such a store and they can be worn ALL DAY w/o any problem whatsoever.I would strongly recommend not purchasing these sneakers.Hoping to save other potential buyers a painful experience.",1
They weren't what I expected. To Fake,0
The product ripped in two places with me just putting them on. I also thought I was getting multiple pairs but there was only one pair. That party could be my error,1
"I bought this for my mom as a gift. It was originally an ok looking bracelet, although the pearls were quite fake-looking. It broke the second time she wore it. I would not reccomend.",0
I have several pair of these Levis 590 jeans that I purchased at Kohls. Those jeans fit nicely and the material is thick nice quality. These from Amazon are thin material and the stitching us cheap. They also fit completely different. The little Levis tag on the pocket and on the inside is also just red without the company name. I haven't seen this with jeans purchased in stores. These definitely seem like a fake.,0
If you don't care what your kid looks like for Halloween then this costume is for you. First of all the material is uncomfortable and if they wear clothes underneath you can see all the creases because the material is so thin. This costume has no shape to it and it makes them look like cheap pajamas.,1
Not even close to the mask shown,1
"Horrible broom. Was breaking apart right out of the box.  I can be 100% sure this broom will not even make it through one night of Trick or Treating for my daughter.  If she lets it drag on the sidewalk at all, there goes the horrible dried out straw that they used to make this horrible ""so-called"" witch broom.  Please save your money and buy a different costume broom. You will be disappointed as much as I was if you decide to buy this. Hope this helps out.",1

somewhat disappointed with the quality. The shoe is not leather.,1

They don't even deserve one star....in fact I should sue the company and im not lying. I don't know where the company for these crocs but they are fake. I slipped and fell at work all because these shoes were not slip resistant as promised. Do not buy these. At least not from Amazon! I even took them to the crocs store and the employee pointed quite a few things that were fake on them in addition to the fact that they are not slip resistant! Im so outraged amazon would sell these type of shoes and lie about them. Thanks alot!(sarcasm),0
"I immediately returned this item because it was fake, Made in China.",0
"I consider myself to be a loyal Ryka customer, not anymore after these.  These supposed ""cross-trainer"" sneakers DO NOT have cushion support or arch support. I felt like I was running barefoot. The product description is totally misleading.  I have been doing aerobics, step classes, cross training, and play volleyball for over 10 years and these shoes do not live up to the description.  I weigh 143lbs and 5'4 I was doing my usual run on the treadmill and had to stop 12 minutes into my run because my feet were hurting on the soles, toe, and arch.  Later that night I had to soak my feet and rub the pain.  A few months ago I bought the Ryka Cross trainer Enhance and had returned those right away too; they had the same problem not enough cushion support.  I wonder who tested these shoes out for Ryka an anorexic petite person.I bought a pair of Rykas about 5 years ago (my 2nd pair at the time) and still have those sneakers and when I compare them to my recent purchase these are inferior to the one I bought 5 years ago, the poor quality is ridiculous. I don't mind paying more money for a good sneaker, this is not. The quality of their sneakers has gone down the toilet.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  Don't waste your time or money on these sneakers.  I wouldn't doubt the 5 star positive reviews on the site are from people who work for Ryka.  There is no way that you could do running, step classes and especially jumping with these sneakers, you will be sorely sorry.  These sneakers SUCK!!  The company needs to reevaluate their design and quality after they do that I may consider coming back to being a loyal customer, otherwise don't waste my time with crappy sneakers.",1

Shipment was good, arrived on time but the product description compared to the picture is completely misleading.",1
"The only reason I (along with many other customers) purchased this product was for the ""magnification"", as displayed in the item description. In reality, these novelty glasses LITERALLY DO NOT provide any magnification whatsoever. The glass is literally just flat plastic. It is absolutely disingenuous to refer to any ""lenses"" whatsoever in the product description. there are no true lenses featured with this product.Aside from the obvious complaint, it should also be noted they are Child-Sized, made from very warped and cheap plastic, and the ""lenses"" continuously fall out of the frames. While only $8, these novelty glasses don't even function as novelty glasses.",1

"I am not really that impressed with this bra.  I do like that it has a thin foam lining, but the lining DOES NOT STRETCH as the product description says it does.  Therefore, it does not conform to your curves & will cause spill-over depending on how well the cups fit.  Another thing is that the straps do slip (in length & off your shoulders) & as other reviewers mentioned, they are almost too long & have to be adjusted to the shortest length.  They also have to be adjusted everytime you put the bra on because after washing they will probably not be where you left them.",1
"The product I bought was not authentic. I thought since I was buying from Zappos, a reputable company and was paying $120, which is well over the retail price, I would be getting the real deal, but I was mistaken. I first noticed that the fluffy wool inside the soles was falling out in large quantities. Upon further inspection, I realized it was not wool at all. The label on the top of the slipper was also not authentic. I am extremely disappointed, I have bought several pair of these slippers as gifts and I'm now going around trying to find out if they are fake as well. After everything, I was told that I have to pay to return these slippers! I pay $100 a year for Amazon Prime and this is just ridiculous!",0

"The jacket was listed as ""Marmot Minimalist Jacket"" & the product description that followed when I clicked on it described it as such also.  It seemed to be an amazing price fot the coat (about 25% the regular price), so I went for it.  Not till the I ordered it, did it appear that is was in fact the ""Marmot Precip Jacket"".  Now as I write my review, it says I'm reviewing the ""Marmot Precip Jacket"", but if I search for ""Marmot Minimalist Jacket"", this exact jacket that I ordered pops up.  It was still a good price for the coat, so I am keeping it, but it is & was falsely advertised.",1
"This was purchased for my three year-old's Halloween costume.  I had read that it was made of cheap plastic, but that doesn't do it's crappiness justice.  It is extremely thin, rigid plastic that tears and marks if slightly bent.  It is only the front of the clock, there is absolutely no backing at all, just an open crevice.  I didn't expect working hands, but I did expect a back.  The whole product cost pennies to make and I paid [...] plus shipping.  It just isn't worth that much.",1
"The product description of these shoes states twice that the uppers are leather, whereas the on receiving them we discover that the shoes themselves are marked as man made materials.

"I own a Seirus balaclava that I bought on Amazon for running in cold weather. Its very form-fitting, but a tad large. I read the reviews and description of the Howler Multi Tasker Pro, both on Amazon and the Chaos website, and thought Id found a winner. I was wrong.When I received it and tried it on, I found that the fit is terrible. Each side of the balaclava bunches near the top, giving a horn-like appearance (think Batman or Count Chocula, but not quite as pointy).I emailed Chaos customer service, and received this response: ""It is caused by the fabric and sewing seems - however, not much can be done to avoid it. It's a tough fitting style, not much forgiveness to it.""I responded that Im disappointed and even pointed out that the description on the Chaos website reads, ""3D form fitting flat panel construction with integrated side gussets help improve fit, form and comfort.""That email went unanswered.I now have a balaclava that I will rarely (if ever) wear, because I don't want to run with a product that makes it look like I have horns. Furthermore, if Chaos knows that its a tough-fitting style with not much forgiveness, why would the company not change the design? And why describe it as a design that helps improve fit, form and comfort. Last, when I emailed back, pointing out the misleading product description, I at least expected a follow-up.",1

My last pair fell apart a few years ago and I hadn't had the funds to replace them. I ordered these after reading the product description, paid a good sum of money for them and for the shipping, waited while they made their slow trip from Germany, and then when they arrived, I discovered the soles were leather. To add insult to injury, I had to pay the expensive postage to return them to Germany. All in all a most disagreeable experience.",1

Also, though I ordered the suggested size of C/D (I am 5'4"" and approximately 140lbs) I could not pull the stockings up over my thighs (and do not consider myself to have disproportionate thighs).

Unfortunately, I had to ask for a refund/return.",1

"Very bad quality, I supposed it was a good watch because of the known brand Invicta.  But it is probably fake or made of bad quality products.

Already wrote to the company and they do not answer, very bad customer care!! Im still waiting for a response and my money back!!!!",0

It is flimsy cheap plastic and is not solid.  There should be a description of the item on Amazon so people know what they are getting.  The clock doesn't work and the heart isn't solid.,1
The inside of the cups had little spots of white sticky substance on them that were impossible to remove.

I always rinse out my new bras before wearing the these spots went unnoticed before wearing.,1

It was awful. the seam down the middle of the wig made it look extremely fake and the color was very off.,0
Freaking terrible. Pictures are SUPER DECEPTIVE!!! Ruined my costume. Now i have to find a wig last minute.  Definitely filing an Amazon A - Z claim!I'm almost certain that 99% of these positive reviews are fake. No one is that enthusiastic about a wig plus all of the images basically say perfect for costume. Weird....that they all basically say the same thing...as if it was created by a single person....,0
"Not what  was expected, was more like dollar store or cheap Halloween store set. Not for people trying to go a out to look good. Too shiny and fake looking, hair fell out everywhere, and everything moved and wound stay still.",0
"Got these as a gift. They are very good fakes. They are too light weight and flimsy to be real however, sitting next to my real ones you cannot tell. I thought they would be real after reading the reviews but upon recieving them I noticed they were made in China (real RB are made in Italy) on the inside of the frame. Oh well, these are a good backup to my real ones! Just be careful eye glass places that carry RB won't fix anything on the (tilt, frame, etc) because they are fakes. Also, fakes should NEVER be 80$.",0
"If I could give it zero stars I would.  Not only was it HUGE.  The body would fit my three year old....but the legs would fit my 9 year old.  Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume.  This showed up without a cape and was a ""Super Hero"" suit.  The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off, and were not even straight lines.  Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by.",1
Too large. I wish they had told me the sizes were for men,1
"I don't like how it already has several horizontal lines the first time i put it on: 5 on the left leg, 1 on the right, of which 2 of the smaller lines on the left leg are already starting to become runs (see pic)",1

"I would recommend that women not purchase these shoes unless you've tried them on or have had a pair in the recent past because of the unusual fit due to the conversion from men's to women's sizes. They have some arch support, but are not particularly comfortable either.",1

Then once I tried them on, and put my hand in the tights while I was putting them on, they ripped! Now there is a hole from the thigh to the ankle! These tights are awful. And whenever my nail so much as stretches these tights just a little bit, another hole is made. Do not buy these tights.",1

"I ordered a pair of monochrome black converse because I already own a pair that is on its last legs. When they arrived, I tried them on and thought immediately that they felt weird. I thought maybe this feeling was because this pair was a bigger size than my last pair. That's when I noticed the logo. Real converses have an embossed, 3-D logo that is clearly defined against the fabric of the shoe. This pair had a flat, poorly sewn on logo. The circle didn't even have smooth edges. I immediately returned and plan on buying from a credible shoe store. I realize this probably isn't amazon's fault but be careful, especially when dealing with this good of a price ($40).",1

"Though the description lists the upper part of these sandals as leather, it is decidedly not.  I suspected that was the case when I initially received them in 2010, but I trusted the description and dismissed my concerns.  The fact that these sandals aren't genuine leather might not be a big deal for some.  But now, in 2011, as I'm looking at them wondering if I should take the time to cut the multitude of strings that are coming from each strap or just throw them out, it's a major issue.Because faux leather doesn't wear nearly as well as real leather, I wouldn't have purchased these shoes had I not been misled by the product description. However, I've uploaded pictures of my sandals under customer images.  If you don't mind having your sandals look like mine a year after you purchase them, have at it.",1

"BEWARE - this product may be a fake.  I bought a set in October and liked them enough to get more in May.  The product that came in May are made very differently.

Personally, I would not take the risk.",0

"NO SCREW DOWN CROWN !!!. The product description included with the watch seems to indicate that this watch will have a screw down crown, as dive watches must. However, on receipt, it quickly became clear that it does not have one; you turn and turn and it never locks down. The product description, and the manual also, is completely generic and doesn't necessarily apply to this specific model. This becomes clear after you look at a few more Invicta 'dive' watch descriptions.  For a 'dive' watch it should be stated specifically if it DOES NOT have a screw down crown.  The saddest part is that my wife really loved this watch, which I purchased as a gift, and it is beautiful, however a dive watch should be practical as well as attractive. I don't believe a watch without a screw down crown will survive in the real world of diving. Sad too, because it has an excellent unidirectional (counterclockwise) bezel with a clicky detent, and the watch has a solid, quality look and feel to it. Nice piece of jewelry, just not a good dive watch.  I guess one needs to read all of the negative reviews to get the full low down on any item. Some people indicated it did not have a screw down crown, but I assumed some people just wouldn't know a screw down crown if they weren't familiar with one.  Kudos to Amazon for making the return process so easy (and free), but the entire hassle could have been avoided with a more precise description.",1

I bought this to go with the costume but the hair was not at all a match to the Austin in the movies.

It is not professional looking, and I was not at all impressed by the microscopic date display. You can barely see the number of the day, and I have good vision.

Not the real thing.  These shoes are faker then fake.  Ecco shoes are real leather and when I got these shoes in the mail they did not feel like leather at all they are made out of cardboard.  I bought the same pair at an ecco store 5 years ago and still have them and I still wear them. I got the ones on amazon a few months ago and already they are ripping and these and it seems like these are glue together because they falling apart at the heals.  What I learn here is to not buy brand stuff on line because you will probably get pirate stuff fake stuff.  Always buy at the store even if you have to pay more at least you will see if you are getting the real stuff.,0

Inside the shoe (on the sole) is black with converse in white lettering6) actual material feels cheap.will add photos later.maybe seller messed up contacting them now.5) rubber toes came scuffed/scratched a bit.6) there is visable glue along the clothe and sole on the side.Would love to be proven wrong.

"If you are like me, I don't usually pay all that much attention to negatives reviews. I figure the person is just a ""sour grapes"" type.  But please take my advise and do NOT buy a Buxton Double Cardex wallet.  The latest version is a cheap piece of you know what.  My wife had an earlier version that lasted her for many years; the wallet was soft and flexible.  The latest version is very stiff and lined with cheap plastic.  The plastic lining in the coin purse section lasted about 2 weeks before it ripped open and all her change disappeared into the bowels of the wallet.  She could only fit about half her credit cards into the wallet because it was so stiff. Please do yourself a favor and visit a store that stocks the Buxton product and check it out before purchasing.  Don't tell me I didn't warn you!",1

"I was really excited to try this out because I'm a super multi-tasker.  I first ordered the L/XL/XXL because my ""girls"" are totally huge compared to their previous size and I couldn't find a size chart on the amazon product description. I used to be a 36 C and they are really big now, so I was really frustrated when I had to return it for the xs/s/m size (+1 star for ease of return.)So then my itty bitty bra comes.  It's got this velcro panel for expansion, which is cool.  Here's where the flaw lies.  In the pursuit of building a ""1-size-fits 50% of women"" bra, it fits horribly.  It is just like a giant panel of material without any contouring.  If I don't want my boobs to be soar at the end of the day, I have to zip it up so tight that the compression of the unit holds me in place, which causes a LOT of rubbing and I was completely raw by day 2.  If you don't zip it up that tight, your boobs just drop, completely unsupported because the fabric goes straight down after the ""cup"" and there is literally no support under your breast.  I tried the straps, didn't help.  I'm right in the middle of the road as the sizing on this particular bra, so it's not a ""this size just doesn't fit you issue.  I can't imagine that this would support anyone unless they were completely flat chested!  I'm so upset...I'd return it if I could.  It was a complete waste of money...",1

"I picked this watch up during a Todays Deals.The watch comes in a great box, and is fantastic upon first opening. However, the quality of the watch is the immediate downside. In person, this watch appears like it belongs in a Chucky Cheese grab machine. The 'mystery metal' case is somewhat dingy and the crystals are barely noticeable.The watchband appears to be made out of some type of fake leather/vinyl, and the band strap retainers are sewn poorly.I should have known a watch this price wouldn't be anything like the fantastic price I paid. I returned this watch, and have not purchased a replacement yet. I likely will be buying a Citizen Eco Drive.",0

"I purchased this product to use on two watches: a possibly fake Swiss Army watch, and a genuine Casio digital runner's watch.  I had no problem with the span of the wrench that some people have written about.  However, the product arrived in a box that looked used.  The number of bits was off - for some reason, someone had included a little plastic bag with three additional bits.  No idea why or how they might relate to a watch.  There are no instructions in the box, but the box does say, and I quote: ""12pc (4 of 3) Screw-On Pins"".  As I mentioned, someone had slipped in an additional 3 pins, so I had a potential 15 pins.  However, none of them contained threads, nor did the sockets that they were to fit into.  So how these might be ""screw-on"" eludes me.  In fact, the sockets are larger than the bit diameters, and with no threads or anything to hold them in place, they fall out.  Now the photo shows the wrench placed onto the watch from the top, so in this position, there is no way that the bits would not fall out of the sockets.  What gives?  Classic Chinese marketing, where claims are made but they border on outright lies? Or just really bad quality control?  I vote for the latter.  You can see evidence of incompetence in the packaging:  it says that it is a two-pin opener, but the picture shows an obvious three-pin device.The cost of returning the item, as I would have to pay postage, wasn't worth it, so I improvised.  I found some old putty and used it to seat the bits into the sockets so that I could turn the device such that the bits were hanging downwards.  With some adjustments, I was able to open the watch backs and replace the batteries.  Since both these watches are supposed to be waterproof to 100 m, I am wondering whether I was able to screw the backs on well enough to make them watertight, as the buts wobbled quite a bit.  I'll find out I guess the hard way if I failed.Overall, this device sucks big time, and I would highly recommend no one ever purchase this product, and that Amazon ban it from sale.",0

"I bought this model from Florsheim about ten years ago when their stores could still be found in the malls. They were my standard dress shoe when wearing a suit. I guess all things change with time.The first thing a noticed when I opened the box was the appearance of the leather. It appeared almost ""fake"", like vinyl shoes you'd by a discount shoe store for a $39 pair of shoes.The next thing I noted was the odd sizing. I ordered a EEE width, and I have to say the were wide enough. I usually wear a EE. The length, however, was over an inch shorter than every other shoe I owned of the same size.

But after using it for 3 months (it did not break), I switched to a Samsonite 3 Pocket (x 2 the price).The size is okay, but sliding things in and out does not seem very smooth.

That's true for the middle zippers, the front pocket zippers.  Just does not feel good at all.  Even after a few months, it does not loosen up.The 4 front pockets are strange.  Two of them are connected ... so it's kinda like a fake pocket.  Couldn't figure out any use for them.  The carry belt that came with it is thin and not very useful.

"I'm updating my review of this bag (see below), which I wrote about a year ago.  Initially I gave this bag 5 stars, because I was thrilled to find a replacement for the bag I had had for many years, but after a few months, the stitching that held the strap on came apart.  Then 2 days ago, the zipper pull fell off which made it impossible for me to unzip the bag.  I was at the vet's with my dog and needed to borrow a knife to pry the bag open. The bag is now unusable.I had my old Ameribag so long that I was looking forward to replacing it with something different when it finally wore out after many years, but I really couldn't find anything that would work better for me -- so I ordered another (black, distressed nylon, extra small) and am very happy with it.

"Tried phoning the Russel Athletic customer service number to confirm all this--but was not able to get through per below. Here is what I sent them in an email.  I suspect they have modified the style of these sweats without changing the PN, Photo, Description, etc. to make it more ""Millenial-friendly.""  The legs seemed to be tapered/snug from the knee down . . .************PLEASE FILE AS COMPLAINT--AND PLEASE COPY PRODUCT MANAGER IN MARKETINGPurchased Men's Sweatpants Item No.  029HBM0  PN 82288 on AMAZON. Been purchasing Russel sweats for years and immediately noticed that these seem to have the ""relaxed fit"" replaced with a ""tapered fit"" bottom leg portion.  The photo does not reflect this on Amazon, nor the Item Title/Description.  Have you changed the style of PN 82288 ""relaxed fit"" men's sweats so that it now has a tapered leg (--without changing the product title/description on Amazon)?  If you have many different ""styles"" etc., this should be included in all advertising/product descriptions (style number or part number which I believe is missing in the Amazon description--making it difficult to compare/contrast various Russell sweats, etc.).I intend to return these to Amazon and write a product review which describes my experiences.  I tried phoning your consumer customer service 800 number twice and was hung up on twice.  I then called your dealer 800 number and they attempted to transfered me to the main operator and I got a recording to leave a message. In the hundreds of Amazon reviews for this product, I discovered another buyer had the same experience.  I will do what I can to crank up the visibility of this issue so middle aged men seeking a ""relaxed fit"" are warned about this.  It appears these sweats have been redesigned for millennials or those seeking ""fitted"" clothing.  (If I wanted fitted sportswear I'd buy Lycra tights.)Also have seen on your website that you also make ""non-pilling"" men's sweats.  Is there a PN I need to look for to find:* Men's Medium (Gray ""Oxford"" Color)* Relaxed fit (no tapering of any kind--so they fit like the ones you've been making for years)* Pockets* Elastic Hem Leg Bottom* Internal Drawstring* Non-pilling fabric* Heavy Weight (if it exists--not thinner cheap fabric stores are trying to peddle)* (Ideally) pre-shrunkP.S.  You could really help the consumer find high quality sweats by including a spec for fabric weight.  This would make it much easier to see the added value in Russel sweats over the cheaper versions sold on the Internet/brick and mortar stores.  (After this bad experience with the style ""switch-a-roo"" I will be very reluctant in the future to buy sweats on the Internet or at least Russel sweats.",1

"Okay! I have a 3 1/2 year old that's in a size 9 already...so I was wondering what size should I get, cause looking at the reviews some says a size smaller and some says a size bigger. I don't know, but I really want my boy to have these shoes! Any suggestions??",1
I bought these for work.  I wear wide widths and own two other pair in other colors.  This pair ran a bit narrower than my other pairs and I will likely keep them and have a cobbler stretch them.,1
"These didn't fit me at all. When I removed them from the package, I had to check the size to make sure i was sent the right size. They looked like aa size small in the waist. Yes..I gotmy legs in them...but when they hit my thighs...it got tight. Let alone get them around my tummy. I'm not a small girl but I bought these with the expectation that they would fit.",1

Horrible. Sneaker cannot be real. They are glued with some kind of silly paddy or something bc before I even wore the shoe the glue stuff was melted all over the inside. If I wear the sneakers my socks get stuck on the inside. Paid almost $50 for nothing. This is ridiculous & the seller should be ashamed.,0
They are beautiful shoes but they squeak when you walk.,1
"I am currently ""between shoes"" as Wilson keeps discontinuing every model I've liked. I generally buy shoes that are labeled ""extra wide"". I've worn shoes the manufacturer has called 2E, 3E and 4E. I don't mind wearing more than one pair of socks, in fact I prefer it.I gave this shoe a try because a tennis specific website indicated this was a good choice for wide feet. It isn't. At least not if you need width in the forefoot. I spent several days trying to stretch these guys out and then finally decided I'd made enough progress to give them a shot on the court. It was a painful experience and I really could not play my game with them on.I think the workmanship of the shoe is top notch but the shape is really not foot-like. If you look at a Nike shoe or a Wilson shoe, they are shaped like feet. This shoe is shaped like a canoe. If your feet are shaped like canoes then you've found your shoe.I think on the basis of my experience with these shoes that I like a comfort oriented shoe. The ride in these things is harsh. Using a car analogy, I am guessing I need a Cadillac type ride and got a Corvette by mistake.",1
fake not original.no warranty.and not working.dont ever buy from this shop,0
"UPDATE 3/13/18: Updating my review as I said I would should the condition of the shoes rapidly decline. I've worn these sneakers almost daily but mostly just to the office, not at all running around fields or city streets etc, and approximately 2 months in the white siding of the sneaker that attaches to the leather upper is separating in a few parts (on one of the sneakers the siding started to separate after basically 1 month). Mind you, this occurred with my old Cons as well, but not 2 months in. I'm pretty sure at this point that these are fake or just shoddier than usual construction. Otherwise the shoes are fine. Nothing else is wrong. But this is concerning in and of itself.First off, I appreciate super fast shipping. I expected these about a week after ordering, but they arrived about 24 hours later. Awesome!Now, to the sneaker itself. I bought these to replace the same sneakers , also purchased on amazon but from a different seller, from 1 1/2 years ago. Upon opening the box and picking up these new sneakers I could tell there were some small changes. Now, does this mean they are fake, or does converse make small changes to the shoe year to year? Im honestly unsure. But the changes I noticed included these new sneakers being much lighter, I can hold the old pair in one hand and the new pair in another and easily feel the difference in weight. The old pair also have the shoe size imprinted on the bottom of the sole, the new pair do not. And the old pair has slightly different font on the tag on the tongue. Also, the boxes ( I still have my old shoe box) are the same except for some slightly different wording on the sticker. So again, are these fake or is there a slight difference year to year or factory to factory? Im unsure. But otherwise, these sneakers seem good. Per usual with converse they run about half a size large, so you might want to order half a size small. I plan on keeping these because the price was good and they still look and feel pretty good, but if they suddenly and quickly fall apart Ill report it.",0

"There are no words to describe how terrible this wig is. I wasn't expecting much, just a cheap costume quality wig I could wear for fun. I didn't expect something that looked real, but I did expect something I could actually wear. I think the best way to ""review"" this atrocious waste of money is to just list the top three flaws.1. ""Curls"" are non-existent. You get a balled up ""wig"" in a hair net style pouch, and when you unravel it you just have a ball of fuzz. You know how, when you go to curl ribbon, sometimes the ends fray and it just gets sort of fuzzy? Yeah, it's kind of like that.2. Shedding is an understatement. Yeah, cheap wigs shed, but this thing is flat out balding. There are chunks of fuzzy red hair leading from my bedroom to my bathroom, and soon enough to my trash can.3. Bangs that should be shot. Love how the picture shows them smoothed over, when in reality you're going to look like Alfalfa. Of course you can't really do anything to fix this, since the second you TOUCH the darn thing, it falls apart.If you want to freak out your significant other or roommates with a big glob of fake hair in the sink or tub, then yeah, buy this thing. If you actually want a wig to wear on your head for halloween/the bedroom/special event, anything really, don't buy this thing. You'd have better luck shaving your cat, and scotch taping that to your head.",0

Supposed to be adult size and it was about 2 1/3 feet tall not what was advertised,1
"I bought this product because of 511's false advertising about its greatness for concealed carry.  First of all, even though the Amazon ad says it's compatible with their ""back up belt system"", I discovered there is no such thing as a ""back up belt system"".  And even though the website now claims compatibility with a ""TacTec System"", there's no such thing as that to be integrated with this jacket, either.  There is NO accessory available that attaches or installs into the jacket.  And what's worse is that 511 KNOWS this, and have known it for over a year.Then there's the fact that this is simply NOT a parka.  Parkas come down at least to mid-thigh length, if not to the knee.  This one, however, comes to just below the belt in the front, and just below the butt in the rear.  It's rather unflattering when viewed from the side, as it is not square cut at the bottom, like just about every other parka on the market.Then there's the hood, which would be really nice if a football helmet were included with the jacket.  As it is, though, one has to wear a baseball cap so that the cap's visor can keep the much-oversized hood from falling down over the face.The outer pockets on this jacket are a mess.  As another reviewer said, they are non-ergonomic.  The ""zippered handwarmer pockets"" are large, with small, zippered openings at the top.  The zippers are small and dainty---hardly the heavy duty one would expect with tactical gear.  But further, if you're using these pockets for handwarmers, you'll not enjoy the zippers rubbing against your wrists.  Further, you'll notice that the pockets are not cut at a slant like true handwarmer pockets are; these pocket tops are parallel with the floor, so that you have to hold your arms awkwardly to have your hands fit into the pockets.  There's room in the pockets for thick winter gloves, but you'll have trouble getting them in and out of the small pocket openings.Further, the jacket is sized a little small.Also, it is extremely difficult to zip it all the way to the top.  To do this, the nicely-extended collar must be scrunched down like a turtleneck, and then, once zipped, it's like wearing a whiplash collar.So it doesn't look right, feel right, work right, or do what it's advertised to do.  But other than that, I can see that it seems to be well constructed---even if poorly conceived.And now let's talk about the price.  This jacket has no features that even remotely justify the very high price.  I can find comparable jackets in the retail stores for half the price.  And so I will.  I'm boxing this thing up to send it back for a refund.As bad as this ill-fitting jacket is, though, the very worst part of the whole thing is the willfully misleading ad copy from 511 Tactical.  They know that there is no ""system"" that fits into or integrates with this jacket, yet they deliberately write their ads to suggest that you're getting something really special.  I searched their website for this ""TacTec System"", and what I found were tactical chest rigs for breast plates and load bearing.  This jacket is ""compatible"" with that in the same way that an oversized sweatshirt is ""compatible"" with it-----that is, you simply put it on OVER the chest rig.  The way the product description is written (Hidden document pockets at the chest offer ample and covert storage along with TacTec System compatibility that allows you to customize your accessory storage quickly and easily.), one gets the distinct idea that this is a jacket designed to carry/store accessories.  Where I come from, this is called ""fraud and misrepresentation"".  But at 511, they're awfully proud of it.I wrote them to voice the same complains you have just read, and this was their response:=====I am sorry to learn that you are disappointed with the Aggressor Parka. This is a solid jacket as it's rated over 4 stars on Amazon.com as well as our own website. I understand that the Aggressor Parka is not for everyone though and if you are truly unhappy with it I would recommend for you to return it back to Amazon for the reasons provided.We appreciate the feedback and will direct it to our designers for future consideration.=====There was nothing about editing the ad copy to match the reality of the jacket, nor any apology for the false impression that it gives.  Nor any acknowledgement that there is not really any particular ""compatibility"" with these load-bearing systems.So I think I'm done with 511 Tactical.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice---well, you won't have another opportunity.",1
"Based on the reviews that stated ""Too large"", I ordered my pair 2 sizes smaller than my normal size. The pair that I received was still at least 2 sizes too big! Clearly, I don't understand the odd Converse sizing. What's the deal?! Returned. I'll buy them somewhere else.",1

"I bought this ""Rothco"" bag in November last year (2012) from Go Commando Gear, and within 3 months the lower clasp broke. It tried to get a replacement but the seller would not take any action saying that the warranty had passed.  Then a few weeks ago (June 2013) the handle broke, the stitching just tore off, really? I only use it to carry file folders from the house to my car, then to my office and back during the week. Not really heavy use, I expected this bag to last years, not months.Because I had some concern about fakes, I did some research on the Rothco website and even called their customer support. The very nice lady I talked to even went so far as to go out to their warehouse, pull a black M-51 bag and describe it to me on the phone.  She confirmed that now the M-51 bag is made with the shoulder strap attached to the handle (bad design flaw) not the sides and that they are using cheap black pot metal, not the ""nickel plated hardware"" that is shown and described on their website. She told me that the website picture and description is outdated.Needless to say, I will not ever be buying a Rothco bag, ever. They have gone cheap and ruined a once good name. They would not do anything to make me a happy customer, she would only refer me back to the re-seller for warranty assistance.Looks like I need to go to the Army surplus store and get a real M-51 bag.

"I purchased these ""UGGS"" for $225 in November of 2017, sold by ""FEET FIRST N.J."" They are FAKE!!!! When I received them I went through the checklist to verify if they were real....Nope! First, the holographic label was not as holographic as they told me. The label did not turn from light in color silver to black but only a darker color of silvery/grey. Next I checked for an animal smell to the leather or sheepskin.... Nope! Then I really began to investigate. When parting with my fingers the so called ""sheepskin"" there were defined vertical stitching lines everywhere I looked....FAKE! Label said made in VIETNAM.... not CHINA. Label on front of boots reads ""UGG"" not ""UGG australia"". The Websites I researched to spot a fake also listed other things to look for in packaging, which i have included in photos as side by side comparison, Fake boot in my photos have a RED line drawn through them for everyone to understand the difference. Because when I thought the first pair were fake, I ordered directly from the official UGGS Australia distributor. (Also $225 per boots). All kinds of differences, subtle enough to get past an unsuspecting buyer.",0

When it says Unisex I think I misinterpreted that. I thought that just meant the sizing but these look like they fit alien feet. Each shoe barely looks different right to left.

Perfect amount of sheerness, however, prior to wearing, i noticed little tears and light running in the tights. I decided it was not too big of a deal and decided to keep them and wear them. The first time and only time I wore them, they ran with just normal walking to dinner for date night. I was VERY upset and hated having to walk around in tights with a run in them. Although they were the perfect color, I feel as though since they're so sheer, they aren't able to withstand many wears. Sad they didn't last one day though:( Will not purchase them again and would not suggest you to unless you'd like a pair of one time wear tights. Great seller and fast shipping however.",1

Even though they felt like the correct size as I was putting them on (I wasn't having to struggle to get them up) and I was putting them on about an hour after I had showered so my skin was no longer wet at that point, and I made sure I had no rough fingernails before I went to put them on, they got a run in them just as I was pulling them up. It was close to the waistline and I was able to fix it with some nail polish but still, the first time out of the box?!?!? That blows!!!!I am a frequent pantyhose wearer and of course I have worn Hanes before but I hadn't tried the Women's Alive Full Support variety until I ordered these from Amazon. I have usually found Hanes Silk Reflections to be decent pantyhose for the price although it does seem like there's at least one pair out of half a dozen or so that must have slipped by Quality Control at the Hanes factory. I think I got that pair with this order, at least I hope so because if all of them fit like this (I felt like my behind was on sideways all day and though they had some slack in them about the feet and ankles they were close to cutting off the circulation in my upper thighs and the waistline had to be pulled up practically to my armpits or else it wanted to be sliding down and visiting my buttcrack.....NOT a comfortable fit AT ALL!)

"Although the tools in this kit are serving my needs for my first watch repairs and restoration, the ""Professional"" in the product description is misleading IMHO. The tools are cheaply made, and this is coming from a person who has worked in industry using tools such as Snap On, Fluke, Excelite, etc. Specifically, the case back tool is ""loose"" and thus you really have to hold the thing tightly, for fear of slippage and scrathing the case back. I actually like the ""sticky"" ball case ""tool"" I bought better. To give you an idea of professional quality, look at any of the Bergeon watch tools. A case back remover by them costs 3-4x what this whole kit costs. Oh well, live and learn ... I'm new to this ;-).",1

"This bag was cute, I would have kept it, but the front snap broke the first day and my things kept falling out. Returned it.",1
"Update: I emailed their customer support and they verified that these don't have memory foam.  Their reply was that the wool material is constructed in a way to provide comfort support however, after a few months of relatively light use the wool is so compacted that it feels as hard as the floor and offers no padding at all.I haven't worn slippers since I was a kid and I was surprised at how difficult it was to find a decent pair.  Our poorly insulated apartment was getting colder than usual and Ive been experiencing a lot of discomfort in the heels of my feet the past year so I was looking for a slipper with decent padding (our floors are fake wood and tile) that would keep my feet warm without getting too sweaty.  I tried on numerous slippers at various department stores and discovered that I didn't like any of the cheap under $20 pairs which tend to be all synthetic and have no padding.  I also didn't like the next level up which usually have some sort of memory foam.  Maybe I weigh too much (185 lbs) but as soon as I step on memory foam it feels like it compresses all the way to the floor and starts hurting my feet.  These Tamarac by Slippers International Men's Cody Sheepskin Slippers cost way more than I originally wanted to spend but they use actual leather and wool and feel high quality when you slip them on.  Because they're wool, they keep my feet warm without making them moist.  Its weird because my feet feel like they're getting sweaty but when I take off the slippers they are dry to the touch.  Maybe this is a function of wool?  This is my first pair of wool slippers so I wouldnt know.  The descriptions says they have a memory foam footbed but it must be a very thin layer or an incorrect description.  The padding is less than I wanted, more like a pair of Vans slip-ons, and I cant stand in them for more than an hour but this is true of any shoe I put on these days.  I might have to go orthopedic. Ive accidentally forgotten I had them on when taking out the trash a few times but because they have a regular shoe sole, it was fine.  Aesthetically, I like that they don't look like moccasins, loafers or Crocs.  I really like them and would give four stars if they had real padding in the footbed.",0

"I bought these Emu's after a lot of research. Was very excited to receive them but very disappointed when I realized what I was sent looked like fake Emu's. They didn't match the photos online at all.1) The heel product label should be brown leather with special stitching. This was not the case with mine. It looked like a rubber emblem.2) The stitching was uneven at the top of the boot. This should never happen with any top-quality boot.3) According to the emuaustralia.com website, the insole should be removeable for the Stinger low boot. It should also have a molded heel. Mine did not.4) There was no Emu fold-over label at the very top of the boot, which is typical of this brand.So, sadly, my boots appear to be fake & I've notified Emu Australia directly that these were sold to me by this particular company (Fusion Apparel).Beware when purchasing.",0
this product said leather sole and it was a manmade sole.I expected a leather sole as well as leather upper as I had bought enzo liberty's in the past and they had leather uppers and soleThe shoe was not described properlyI am going to have the manufacturer look at this shoe.  i believe it is a fake. the heels wore thru after two wearings and the sole has a veneer of hardness and underneath seems like a glued together cardboardlike substance,0
"I have never ordered a REAL pair of Jack Rogers that come in a brown non discript shoe box.  The interior stamp also does not match the stamp in the actual Jack Rogers I just bought at a Belk's department store.  The reason people write bad reviews about these shoes not holding up is if they are fakes then they are only built to LOOK like a Jack Roger shoe, not have the durability or the quality of a real Jack Roger shoe. Buyer Beware, I sent mine back and went to a reputable Jack Roger's dealer.  These shoes usually last me several seasons and its not worth saving $30 on knock offs that will fall apart in four months.",0
Terrible!! The style was sold as front fastening but was BACK fastening instead. One would either need to be an contortionist or require a maid to assist as did Scarlet O Hara.  I do not trust Amazon to replace it correctly so will have  to search elsewhere. I am very disappointed and angry.,1
I received fake Timberlands.,0

"The costume did not arrive, and when I checked online I was told there was nothing I could do to get it here faster. A phonecall was made and it was then I was made aware on Thursday the 25th my costume was sitting in a warehouse in Texas, a long ways from Missouri, not even shipped out of the warehouse yet. Therefore, the costume (shipping out of Target stores) arrived on Tuesday after Halloween which was on the Sunday before. Yet, I had my accessories to make me feel worse about the situation. I was told I could not sign for the package but it was left in the mailbox and would cost me more than I had spent to go about getting my money refunded!",0
"I via my friends acct. purchased these from Ibex Optical on Amazon however when I received them I found they had cheap plastic lenses and it was immediately noticeable that they were lighter and didn't have the balance compared to my other pair of 3379's which I was replacing. Ray-Ban clearly lists the RB3379 with RayBan P lenses as being Crystal/Glass however these appear to be a cheaper version from another country, might as well be fake.",0
Don't buy there fake .,0
"They have charged my credit card, and not responded with anything, including the purchase order of shoes, or answered inquiries I have entered via phone and e-mail. The shoes are now two months overdue...horrible company",0
"The ring was really beautiful when I got it. It wasn't fake looking at all. Very nice look. I had the ring about a month and went to a Woman's retreat went to the bathroom and when I went back to the table and looked at my hand the center stone had fallen out. I just didn't feel like it was worth my time to send it back and go through a lot of hassle about it. I don't feel like there's a problem with the jewelry itself, I think maybe I just got a defective one. I would order again.",0
Needs a better product description was not expectating a one piece pull over Halloween costume for as much as I paid. Was expecting separate jacket and shirt also not rubber assassins symbols.,1
"the two shoes are Taupe, but are  two different taupe colors.....looks odd.....could be the nap is backwards",1
"Who doesn't put pockets in sweatpants?  Evidently, Hanes doesn't.  The color & fit were fine, but no pockets is a deal buster for me.  Never even thought to look at product description, since all sweatpants should come with pockets.  Now use as winter pajamas.",1
"The first two months I wore this shoe I rolled my ankle at least a dozen times, to the tune of 2-3 times a week.  After those two months, I learned to put my weight on the inside of the shoe, where I've had less problems, other than it is ridiculous to have to walk with my weight purely on the inside of my feet (very unnatural).  The problem lies in the balance of the shoe (or shape of the sole).  Once your foot is angled outwards at over 25-30 degrees, putting weight down on the center of gravity of the shoe will result in the shoe twisting your ankle.  For perspective, this is your foot being raised less than 1/3 of the way up, which is common on hilly terrain or uneven sidewalks.The five star reviews really had me sold, but after rolling my ankle an uncountable number of times, I'm thoroughly done with this shoe.  How it garners as many 5 star reviews is beyond me, but if you did buy it already, return it asap, your ankles will thank you forever.",1

"I've worn this brand for years and never once has there been a problem with quality or my size C/D. These have always been my go to pantyhose because I love the material, they're elegant, very supportive, and they last. But what I just got online came in the proper packaging but no adhesive seal on the open tab. No brand or size on the tag of the pantyhose. Didn't feel like the usual material. They were too short for my usual size. And they came out of the package with a hole and a run already included. The barely there color was also more of a dark tan. I highly recommend the brand but not this seller.",1

"These may look like Wayfarers at a distance but anyone will be able to spot them as fakes. They feel very cheap. The plastic is soft, like a toy, not hard and slick like you expect sunglasses to feel. They're great if you're looking for a cheap 'Risky Business' Halloween costume, but they're not sturdy enough for everyday wear.",0

Very weak and flimsy product.  Not even 3 dimensional -- barely half a heart. Can't believe I paid $9.99 for this accessory.  Strongly suggest anyone seeking a Tin Man costume find an alternative accessory for the heart.,1
Fake! The material is off and on top of that someone took it upon themselves to write inside my shoe with a blue pen. I did NOT pay over $100 to receive fake shoes with handwriting inside of them.,0

Most uncomfortable boot ever. Soles have no cushion deff not made for standing any length of time . inside finish is very hard at seam locations and VERY uncomfortable even when worn as loose as can get. I hope they ( break in ) some and are tolerable otherwise these will go in the trash.  JUNK JUNK JUNK,1
"bought because of the review it got , it fit terrible, no support, wires dug in  I am not a small busted woman and this bra was not at all what I expected I am returning",1
"I read the reviews, so I was aware that the costume ran small. I thought that it would be okay for my husband because he is only 5'3"" and weighs 135 lbs. This costume still did not really fit him. He had to buy supportive pants for underneath or it was going to be a bit embarrassing for him. I also altered it to loosen the crotch area. We managed to make it work, but he wasn't as comfortable as I would have liked. It's a shame that it is so ill fitting because it is the most accurate costume that I could find. This costume can not be intended for any adult male. It is a child's size.",1
Looks completely fake in person. You can tell from a mile away that they're plastic. The lenses also don't do anything. It's just tinted plastic...,0
"I buy several color pair of timbs during this time a year and I just didn't find my size in wheats at the outlet store. I ideally go straight to timbs website but I was shopping for someone on amazon and decided to search timbs. I saw the reviews on here and thought I could trust the purchase. As soon as I took them out I knew they were fakes. The stitching is coming loose and the fabric is barely holding together. Their is random glue all over the place to wear even if I tried to wear it you could see. The tree stamp on both shows don't really match in color. The glue line that holds the material to the sole is thick in most areas and in other a line that looks like it was erased. So the suede is darker. See in the pic where the laces go through, the fabric seems to already be coming apart. I just received these today and have not worn. If I wear these I'm certain they will fall apart. I have included pics, hope this helps. Now I have to return these and order directly from timberland. '",0
Had to add padding and a strap and still too big for an adult.,1

Bad design as the 2 flaps in front (where you put credit cards) weight the bag to tip and everything falls out.  I used the bag once and one of the flaps has already started to tear away from the purse.  JUNK.,1

Im so dissapointed cause i believe that was the original but not you are selling a fake product.,0
I bought these for my wife and gave them to her as a 'just because' gift in September 2014. It's only been a few months and they're already showing serious signs of deterioration. The gold covering is starting to peel off in three different places even though they spend most of their time in the leather case that comes with the glasses. If these are genuine Ray Bans then I'll never spend more than $10 for sunglasses ever again. I expect genuine products to be of better quality. Save a few bucks folks and just get some decent sunglasses elsewhere. Or if your dead set on Ray Bans go to a legitimate Ray Bans store. You're going to pay a ridiculous amount of money for them but you'll know without a doubt that they're legitimate and genuine. These are just REALLY expensive fakes out of China.,0
"The necklace was held together by a loop and bead. Because the end was simply knotted into a loop, in a matter of weeks, the loop became undone and the necklace fell apart. I tried retying the knot every now and then, but it wasn't worth the constant attention to it. Also, the pendant has a sheen that makes it look like plastic designed as fake metal. I could've made this necklace as a kid with a string, some beads, and a shiny looking pendant.The earlier reviews made this necklace seem good, but I have to agree with Kelsie Lynn's and Tyson R. Holder's reviews. I might like this if I were a kid and didn't care for the quality, but that's not the case. I bought a new necklace as this wasn't worth my money.",0
"These guys look fake, the color is wrong and the fur inside is different.  My daughter is embarrassed to wear them.",0

"I was debating between a 1 and 2 star rating.  These Jockey briefs are good quality, but Jockey has a sizing problem between sizes 7 and 8.  I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon, checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s.  There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter.  I can't complain about the quality of Jockey, but sizing is a totally separate issue.  The size 7s will be donated to Goodwill ASAP.",1
Very cheaply made for the price.,1
My grandson is 3 and this is too big for the 8 year old. Very upset wish we would have returned.,1
Tear and get runs way too easily.,1
"The quality of the 2016 boots are terrible compared to the older version. I owned a pair four years before the soles finally gave out completely, and I loved them. the leather was thick and wore in nicely. The ladder kick sole and steel shank were great for slippery ladders and shovels. I do a lot of cabinetry work that is hard on boot toes and front sides, and the double leather toe cap and thick leather of the old version helped a lot with wear.Unfortunately, the 2016 Wingshooter 838s I purchased are made of thinner leather, and the double toe cap is fake--it's only one layer of thin leather with stitching to look like a double layer. In just 9 months I've completely worn out the toes, and now the sides are starting to go. I'm going to apply an aftermarket toe coating to get more life out of them, but the coating creates drag that affects my dexterity while working. For the price and the Red Wing association, I expected more, but the quality has decreased terribly. I will not purchase Irish Setter boots anymore.",0
Shirts are completely fake and do not reflect photos.  Sizes are also not aligned.  Very disappointed with purchase,0
"I have had so many Hanes pantyhoses in c/d size, but this is not c/d for sure. It was too small and short. Very off size and false advertisement. Unless Amazon is selling defected or off sizes of this brand/style.",1
The costume does not come the way it looks in pic...the head piece is different.  I called Amazon and the girl overnighted me another one and she even described what the pic looked like but I got the same costume with the wrong head piece.  I would recommend buying at store so u can see it in person.,1

" The instruction came watch different model .I wanted simple watch stopwatch 14 year old daughter refing soccer , watch complicated use without instruction .",1
"I bought a black size M version of this shirt in 2016 and it quickly became one of my favorite shirts. It fit me great and was thick and sturdy but not overly so.Fast forward to June 2017 and I decide to order four more of these shirts since I loved the first one I bought so much. I notice a difference immediately on arrival. The shirt seems thicker and wider, and I noticed it says Made in Honduras, whereas my last one was made in Guatemala. I toss one of the shirts in the wash to see if it'll shrink down to the size of my old one, but the sizing is still different. It's wider and longer with a smaller neck opening and thicker fabric. It might fit someone else well but it wasn't the same fit I bought last year, which is what I was looking for. Worth a gamble I guess, but don't expect the same shirt each time you buy.",1

For reference, I am 5'2, 115lbs, and have never had an issue with the fit of tights. I couldn't even get these on entirely and they looked seriously strange.",1
"I was disappointed in the purchase of this bra. I thought it would be padded and it was not. Also, the bra was itchy and uncomfortable.",1
I got a 3x-4x that fit more like a 1x. I put a run in the stocking trying to get them on. I've never had a problem with that before when stockings run true to size.,1
" Its great like Nylon , description say cotton .Just warning case looking .",1
too small,1
These fit 2 sizes to small. Than I normally wear,1
"I ordered this costume based off all the good reviews but I should have paid more attention to the negative ones. I got this for my 3 year old for Christmas as he loves to dress up. If you have a kid who loves to dress up - chances are you know the costume takes a beating so needs to be really good quality or it won't last too long. This costume is so cheap it's shocking. The fabric is thin & the fasteners are tiny pieces of Velcro. If you intend this costume to be used ONCE for Halloween, this will likely be fine. But for a kid who dresses up a lot, don't waste your money. Second issue - size chart. I ordered the size according to the chart & its way too long. I couldn't even begin to give you suggestions on sizing so... good luck w that. Finally, the cape has a pretty noticeable color transfer on the ""S"". Half is orange & half is yellow. Picture attached.",1
"This bra fits way smaller than actual size. It is a pretty bra, but should get next size up if you want it to fit",1

"My favorite jeans are my Levi's boot cut 515 jeans size 4 short with 99% cotton & 1% spandex. I'm 5'3 and have a hard time finding jeans that are just the right length for me. So when I picked out the Levi's perfectly slimming 512 boot cut size 4 short with 99% cotton & 1% spandex in indigo rinse, I was confident they would be a perfect fit. When I opened the package and felt the jeans they felt cheap and very stretchy. I tried them on and they came up and over my belly button i don't remember seeing high waist in the description. The waist, hips and thighs fit good, but from right above the knees down they were very baggy and looked like flare jeans. I checked the inside tag to read the fiber blend. The tag said 84% cotton, 14% polyester and 2% elastic (the Amazon description says 99% cotton & 1% spandex). Yuck no wonder it felt cheap and had a fake denim look and I would hate to wear these on a hot day with that much polyester in them. The tag also said they were made in Pakistan. So I looked at the tag of my beloved Levi's 515 jeans and they are made in China and have 99% cotton & 1% spandex. I'm scared to order the Levi's 515 on Amazon because I might get them in the gross polyester blend. I hate these jeans they feel gross and look like the flare jeans that I wore in the late 90's and early 2000's. The only good thing I can say is that the length fit.",0
"I got a smaller cup size than I normally wear just to be safe.  Still way too big.  too much support at the tops of my breasts (where there isn't as much breast because it is all the bottom.

Normally a C cup, the B is too big.",0

"I have really small boobs and i bought these to fill out my wedding dress. The box says its meant for all sizes but these cups are a bit large and stick out of all my clothes and bras.When I did manage to fit them into my clothes with out being visible, they still looked weird. They tend to slide around a bit which is expected, but they look really weird with the nipples which end up pointing inward or in opposite directions.These things did not enhance my appearance at all, they made my slim body look matronly since these fake boobs are a bit heavy and sag. I think it made my fit 25 year old body look more like a late 30s out of shape, had a few babies body. The transformation freaked me out and actually made me feel a little depressed.Anyway, I think it's just this brand that has this effect, my mom and my grandma have these but in a different brand, ive tried them on and they weren't as saggy, didn't slide around as much and over all looked natural.",1

Amazon is great about getting me what I order or fixing issues. What I am having a problem with is that until I get the email notifying me that my delivery was made I do not know it is here. I have had packages stolen from my door AFTER the picture is taken. What happened to ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door? I work from home so a bit of old-fashioned curtsey would be great. FedEx does it. UPS does it. USPS does it. Why can't the Amazon drivers do it?,0

"Wish there were half sizes. As the 10 is slightly too big, where the 9 would be too small.They are hard to get good traction on wood floors tend to slid around. Maybe since they are still new.Update after owning for less than a month; The product description says ""The thick rubber sole gives it durability and traction for both indoor and outdoor wear.""Yet, after a few weeks of light wear around the house they are not comfortable to wear on non-carpet surfaces. Walking on the wood floor feels like concrete. Walking around barefoot is better as the soles are too stiff and feels like hard cardboard.Not to mention the fabric on the bottom of the sole is starting to come off. Have not even had these for a month. Not to mention have not worn these outside.",1
"I have two complaints:1. The color is wrong.  This scarf is purple, rather than dark red/burgundy.  Kind of hard to tell at first but you can't un-see it once you notice.2. The product description says ""100% Lamb Wool"", but the scarf I received is acrylic.  It says Acrylic right on the package so I'm not sure why Amazon would say it's wool.Maybe this is OK for some people but it really bothered me that it was the wrong color.  I ended up ditching the scarf and going for a burgundy/gold tie instead.",1

"I ordered these slippers thinking I would have a smaller, cheaper spare backup to my Outdoor Designs Men's Down Booties which are perfectly toasty, but get worn down after a couple of winters of indoor use.  I somehow latched onto the word ""down"" in the product description, but as far as I can tell (by feel, and there is no label except ""Made in China""), these Baffin slippers are completely synthetic, and do not keep my feet warm even in a 68+ degree room.",1

"This costume is so small that it barely fits my 2yo regular size boy, yet the hat is so big that even fits on an adult's head. My son couldn't have the complete look when the hat didn't fit.

"Very cheaply made. When I opened it up there was already a hole where the red and blue materials were stitched together. From the back, the materials don't match up so the red material looks crooked. Thankfully the cape covers it but it's a little disappointing.

Way too big. I have a pair of 32's I've been wearing for 3 years and I bought these to replace them. Tried them on and they were 5 inches past my knees... Way too long,1
Boot felt more like a leather slipper than a leather boot---my foot seemed to roll up against the leather on the inside of the step.  Size should have been correct on this style of foot shape.  I think the real problem was the lack of structure on the arch side of the boot.,1
"Sadly these are most likely fake.  I had the exact same pair for 7 years and purchased these as a replacement.  I suspected upon receipt that they were not as high a quality as my previous, store-bought pair.  The lenses weren't as clear, the gradient was a little ""off"", the frames felt cheaper, and they just didn't fit right.  I wore them through the summer and grew increasingly disillusioned with them - the lenses just never wiped clean, even with expensive solution.  So my advice is spend the extra $40 and go to a Sunglass Hut or other store.",0

I'm not sure if they are worth $74.00 (which is what I paid) they look like they are made of leather and wood. Though the quality isn't nearly as nice.

For one the hat is the size of my adult head and my son couldn't even wear it with the costume.  This costume is said to fit up to a size 7 i think it said. My son is a size 3T-4T and it was hard getting it on it was so small.  The fabric is the thinnest crapiest material ever and with little effort i could rip it right in half if i wanted.  The eye on the costume is not attached.. it merely slips into little slots.. since it kept stabbing my son in the neck when he would sit, he was able to pull it off with no effort and wouldn't allow it back on.  So he walked around without the eye or hat.  Next time i will just pay for a sturdy costume from a thrift store for $8 and not feel so disappointed.",1

"I bought several pairs of this pantyhose.  Two of the pairs had a run in them before I even took them tried to put them on.  I called the company and they do not do refunds for that.  So I wasted money.  Of the ones that did not have runs in them, they are okay but do not last for the amount of money you spend on them.  I will not buy them again.  It is so disappointing to now find good fitting pantyhose for the larger sizes.  I like the ones that have control top and reinforced toes.  I just have to keep looking",1
"I was a bit disappointed with the delivery as it stated that I would receive it Oct 07, 2014.  My son needed it on Oct 10th for schools protect, So Now that I receive it I will find something to do with it I guess.  The 2 stars given were for the seller not communicating with me in regards to the delivery, but the shirt fabric seems ok.  I did expect the shirt to fit my son a bit in the large side, but that's how he wanted it so it's ok",0

I've been wearing heavy duty 100% Cotton Fruit of Loom pocket t-shirts for decades and now you can't find one anywhere. I think they have turned production over to about 20 foreign countries and allow them to put any description on them that they want to. They evidently make them as cheap as they can with no over site from Fruit of the Loom and that's what you get - a cheap, thin, scratchy, imitation of what they advertise.

"I am awaiting a response from the seller because I want a refund. I ordered the ""Sky"" blue and it looks nothing like pictured. I uploaded 2 pictures to this item up top, so people will actually be able to see what color they will get getting. I wish I would have never ordered it.The fabric is VERY thin(you can see through it) and the overall quality is very poor. Is this Scarf/wrap soft? Yes, very soft. I love the way it feels. If the color had been even some what close to the shimmery blue pictured, I wouldn't be AS upset, since it was less than $10. However, I know a lot of people are snatching these up thinking they are going to be good quality based on the product description and a few positive reviews and not to mention how gorgeous the colors look and plan on giving them as Christmas gifts. I would be soooo embarrassed if I had given this to someone. I can get better quality from Walmart, actually, this scarf is made in china based on the tag, so I might be able to find it there.I'm glad I didn't order more than one like I was going to do at first.I will definitely not be keeping it. Lets see how long it takes for them to respond and send me a return label.",1

"I am a solid 32DDD. I've been measured and that is the size of bra I wear in brands across the board. This bra has this weird extra nipple room that I did not need. I'd probably be able to fit a tablespoon in there and fill lit perfectly. It isn't that the cup is too big, it's only this extra nipple space. The bra is also scratchy. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again. I cannot wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room, and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect. I wouldn't compare it to the torpedo boobs you'd see on Marilyn Monroe and the likes, but it definitely does give a point to the breasts. I will only be able to wear this bra with clothing that is thicker, like sweaters, or dresses that are double layered or have thick material. I also ordered Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra. This bra is AMAZING. The Bali Bra in my size has 4 hooks and very large straps also, the cups go very high on the breast, covering almost the entire breast, making it illogical to wear with anything that shows even a little chest (not breast) because the bra is visible. The Wacoal bra is unbelievably comfortable and only a tad bit more in price.",1
"This mullet was really poorly made, it looked totally fake. I had to go out to buy a new one at a party store because it made my costume look very bad.

I thought it might stretch and get comfortable....big mistake.  Something is very wrong.  I had this same issue with shirts recently.

Aesthetics are appreciated in the area of ""Man Purse"" accessories (Rugged, utilitarian look)I will keep the unit because returning it is more of a hassle than it is worth.  I intend to use it for books and papers but it's not very suitable for that either - it collapses under its own weight, won't stand upright, storage compartments are not suitable for pens and other office tools.Caveat emptor.",1

I'm almost too embarrased to wear it because it looks so fake. For those reviewers that stated the ring was ""gorgeous"" and ""looks real"", they clearly don't have diamond experience. Maybe I'm a snob, but don't get his ring thinking it'll pass off as real. Think about it like this.... what you pay for is what you get.

"As others have identified, this came with a smell that was overbearing. A smell of sulfer or fake leather, but very strong.I like the wallet, but, the smell was something I could not get over. I would have just returned it, but I wanted to see if I could get the smell out and soaked it in oder removers, and washed it in a dish washer and washing machine a few times, and to my complete surprise, the oder was still very strong. useless now. Travelon got their money. I will likely not by this brand again.",0
"I ordered these after a reading reviews and a couple friends owned them.  The shoes fit great, and were extremely comfortable right out of the box.  I wear them on weekends and after I get home from work.  Unfortunately, I noticed the sole on one shoe was breaking away from the nubuck material, two weeks past the Amazon cut off for returns.  I will not be ordering any more of these shoes, unless I can find a brick & mortar store who will offer them at a similar price, with a longer return period.",1

"This was my first pair of Tom's, so I wasn't entirely sure what size to order, so I relied on some reviews.. I typically wear a 9-9.5, so I ordered a 9.5 because some reviews had said that it was necessary to go on the larger side with this particular shoe. They were WAY too big, unwearable, as my feet did not even stay in them when I walked. Ok, no problem, I'll return them and get a 9. Well I read some more reviews afterwards claiming that shoes from this seller are fake. I went to go take a closer look at mine and realized they are a 9.5W... Not only did I not order a wide, according to the Tom's website the company doesn't even sell shoes in wide, only medium. So glad I checked, as I was about to go ahead and just order the 9's. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything from this seller and will definitely go directly through Tom's. Lesson learned.",0

I have been assured a refund is coming and they are a reputable company.  The jury is still out on that.

This means that not only would I have to eat shipping costs on the initial order due to their misrepresentation, but would also have to give them the entire cost of the item back in restocking fees! Here is their exact language in the e-mail:""A $10 or 20% Restocking Fee (whichever is greater) will be applied to all authorized returned items. This is to supplement for additional costs associated with processing your return and because the item ordered was the item that was received.  Shipping charges are non-refundable. Any returned orders with missing items or without original packaging will NOT be credited. Please double check to ensure you have included all of the pieces and packaging before sending us your return package.""This is absolute robbery! The mistake was theirs, not mine.

I have worn this bra for years and love it.  Ordered this last one and never checked the size before I opened it.  I ordered a 42D and the bra delivered was a 44DD.  When I wore it briefly this evening it felt very uncomfortable and large in the cup.  I just thought the bra was redesigned but upon removing it I checked the tag and realized it was a full size too large.  Unfortunately for me I wore it and my husband inadvertently destroyed the packaging so I can't return it.  Money wasted but lesson learned to check the size before wearing.,1

Both shoes fit differently.  Very disappointed.  And I have to pay a fee to return them.  Not acceptable.,1
"I ordered the Dark Earth colored shoes as recommended by the highest rated review here.  The shoes came quickly, and they look very nice.  A very nice color of orangish brown.  The fit was great, and they were very comfortable.  The first time I wore them out for a full day was when I went to Disneyland with my friends and girlfriend.  It had drizzled the night before so the paths were wet.  The is the point where my shoes became banana peels and I began slipping all over the place.  On concrete, yep I'd slip, on wood, there I go, woosh like a downhill slalom olympian, those metal covers for utility access?  Boy if you stepped on those without looking, you'd be yards ahead of your friends before you knew it.I'm sad that these shoes simply aren't safe.  I work in residential construction and really like slip-on shoes when I'm doing inside work and am frequently taking my shoes off as I enter the house.  Slip-ons are just easiest.  Additionally, sneakers are generally more preferable to roofing jobs than steel-toed boots as you can grip the metal surface better.  I was hoping these would be useful there as well, but I wouldn't dare go on a metal roof with these things, if they can't handle pedestrian life, they don't belong on light construction projects.So in short, I wouldn't trust these shoes for every-day use, much-less my lighter projects, I can't afford to slip and hurt myself, I'd be unable to work.  I hate to write a negative review, but safety concerns should be mentioned.",1

On the underside of the shoe the is ""made in mexico"" stamped into the leather.  after seeing all of these things, i ordered a pair from belks to compare.  when they arrived, the box was considerably bigger in size. when i opened the box up the shoes were placed on their sides next to each other and had paper stuffed under the leather strap for support. when i pulled them out they looked so nice compared to the fake ones i got from amazon. i am very pleased with the ones i got from belks and very very disappointed in amazon for carrying a fake product without clearly stating that these are not authentic Jack Roggers.",0

"I have been wearing etnies as my not-at-work-shoes since 1997.  Since then I have always had at least 2 pair in my closet, and at times 3 pair.  I suspected they had gone downhill after my last pair, the Fader.  The are all synthetic, and not nearly as comfortable as suede.  I hate the fat tongue that has been the trend for the last few years.  I have preferred a standard suede bmx/skate style shoe for most of my life.  Nothing fancy or flashy.  For many years etnies has provided that for me, and I have always held my etnies near and dear to my heart.  Everything they make now appears to be primarily or entirely synthetic, and either has a huge over stuffed tongue, or is a new slimmed down version of their old stuff that is just too darn low profile for me.  As previously stated I have been wearing etnies for a while.  I have had many a pair.  The new synthetic uppers don't breathe as well or last as long as suede.  I used to ride bmx, and the suede always outlasted the synthetics. I don't ride anymore to speak of, and the suede still outlasts the synthetics. My new pair, this pair (the Kingpin) fooled me. The description was pretty vague.  I got them based mostly on the picture, which looked to me like suede and a normal tongue.  Nothing in the product description said otherwise.  What I got is another synthetic shoe with a huge tongue.  I am tempted to return them, but at the end of the day I need some shoes, and these are already here.  I almost got a pair of pumas that were exactly what I wanted minus the etnies name.  I knew these etnies were a gamble, but I went with them due mainly to nostalgia and a hope that they would be what I was looking for.  This will probably be my last pair of etnies if they change.  Getting old's a drag.",1

No packaging whatsoever.  No paper label as shown in the picture and no plastic bag to hold the cigarettes.  I received two fake cigarettes thrown into a mailing envelope.

"Having worn Lee relaxed fit jeans for many years, I am very disappointed in this model. There's too much spandex and the fabric feels thin and lightweight. The waist is oversized and the thighs are definitely not ""relaxed"", so any bending of the knees results in the jeans sliding downward. The product descriptions aren't very helpful, as the different colors actually have different amounts of cotton/spandex. I've found the fit varies by the content, so I'll have to keep ordering by trial and error to find a pair that fits me. I've heard that Lee has corrected some of the fit problems and I suspect that there are still a lot of the older jeans in the market.",1
Two pairs of tights in the package. One pair arrived with a hole in the calf and the second pair didn't survive a wash (in a mesh lingerie bag) without getting a hole. Dreadful tights.,1
"Very loose in the heel, cannot be worn without some modification even though another pair of a slightly different style fit fine.",1
Worst product I've ever bought on Amazon.  The cardboard it's packaged in is much firmer than the heart itself.  It's thinner and more flimsy than a milk carton.  I thought plastic meant hard plastic.  Didn't make it 5 minutes before ripping.  Would have been better off printing a paper heart.,1
This would've been perfect if not for the red underwear part. It is shaped like a thong...and looks weird on my son who usually wears a 3T.  The costume overall fits him but the undewear part comes so high on the sides and is somewhat narrow.  Sending this back.,1
I did not like the item because it looks different than what is described.It is not sheer like they mentioned.,1
hair is not dreadlock but like a curled hair.  Not a rasta style.  Hat is rasta style.

"I've been wearing Merrell Jungle Mocs in women's 7.5 since the 90's, but had issues with the last 2 pairs I have ordered from Amazon in the past year. These black suede were so tight in the width I could hardly try them on, and I walked out of the heels with each step. They feel like  a narrow width, but marked as M/B. My feet fell asleep withing 5 minutes of trying them because they were so narrow. These are getting returned. The last pair I returned about 6 months ago was not sewn correctly  and stretched out into a sloppy mess in a few wearings. I don't know if this retailer is selling Merrell defects at a discount, or Merrell itself is having quality issues. The Jungle Mocs I got back in the days when you could only find Merrell at REI or other outdoor specialty retailers, were of far superior quality.",1

"Since it's not clear from the product title that these shoes are for girls only, and we took the M and W in the sizing choices to signify men's or women's (boys' or girls') rather than medium and wide sizes, my new bride and I purchased a pair for her young son/my stepson to wear in our wedding when we couldn't find similar saddle shoes to match mine in local department stores. We were profoundly disappointed (understatement) to discover far from home and with the big day at hand that he couldn't wear them due to the mistake. He wore hiking shoes, since it was that or sneakers. It was all we could do to drag him out of the room without dress shoes, he was so mortified. After the wedding, when we looked up the product page and discovered how this had happened, he told me that he wanted to burn the shoes, he was so disgusted. We left them behind in our room, and I hope they end up with a girl who can wear and enjoy them.Yes, the detailed product description posted far down the product page (off-screen beneath other info and rows of related products) indicates that the shoes are for girls. So one could say this was our mistake. But we never saw the details, nor felt the need to go hunting for them, since all the info we thought we needed appeared at the top of the page and on the sizing and order screens. I hope the good folks at School Issue Footwear, who presumably didn't intend to mislead anyone, will revise the product title to make it clear that these shoes are intended and sized for girls only, so that other parents aren't similarly disappointed. When they do, I'll be glad to revise this review.",1

My immediate impression was very favorable. They really seem to be a quality product.Disappointment set in as soon as I slipped them on. I'm in no way, shape, or form as overly muscle developed as a lot of my weightlifting colleagues. In fact, from the way most other pants fit I seem to be quite average. But these pants were very snug in the thighs to the point of being too restrictive. Not at all what I'd expect from a serious ""tactical"" product.Adding insult to injury, I'm burdened with a return fee of nearly 30% (ouch). I suggest trying to find these someplace where you can slip a pair on before pulling the trigger to purchase.",1
Not happy. Both costumes were bent .. It was almost too small and my son is only a size 3. Disappointed.,1

Then they are honestly modifying their statement.Never knowing that the 30 gig iPhoto would not work in the dock, I used it, for two weeks, and it somehow worked,then it stopped working in the dock.(The sound is very good,  by the way). After contacting Harmon/JBL technical it was then that I found out the Photo would not work. The technician told me the Photo was new,and Apple had not informed JBL the Photo was coming out. The tech told me to use the Photo with the supplied cord (not via the dock), and call back in 2 weeks. Maybe by then Harmon would have a solution to using the Photo with the On Stage.Very dissatisfied with the business integrity of Harmon/JBL!",1

"I have had about 15 pair of these exact shoes in my life.  They wear out every 6 months or so and I replace them.  The pair I had before these were great!  I had purchased them at an actual Merrell store at the Tanger Outlet in Iowa.  The pair before that were awful.  I had bought them at Scheels and the left shoe was larger than the right and my foot slide around.  I took a chance and bought these via Amazon.  The arch in the right foot is so high and uncomfortable that I wore them for a week and started getting shin splints in my right leg.  Something is not right about this pair of shoes.  So, this past weekend, I went to the Merrell Store at the Tanger Outlet and bought another pair, and they work great!  I have a serious concern that the item being sold here, may be a fake, or that Amazon and Scheels get the class B shoe, and the Merrell store gest the Class A.  Anyways, Merrell shoes are awesome, this shoe is awesome, I just don't think you should buy it here.  Go to a Merrell store direct if you can!",0

"It only took 4 days since I ordered this here in Amazon. I was hesitant at first to buy a watch on line especially Seiko watches knowing there are a lot of fake ones circling around. But still gave it a try since I can't find anything around my area with this kind and with this prize? I gave it a try. It came with very good packaging including its original box and papers inside. The first thing I checked if it's really an automatic watch. I hate battery operated watches! It seemed look original to me and when I compared it online it also matches with the product descriptions and its numbers. It has ""MALAYSIA MOVEMENT KY"" written on the transparent cover at the back of the watch. I checked it online to confirm its authenticity. Just checking... I bought this for work and fits really well. I gave it 4 stars for the ""MALAYSIA"" written at the back. I like JAPAN better! All in all, I still like it!Update: November 17, 2013I noticed on the first week since I started wearing this watch it has been losing at least a minute after a couple of days. I haven't done anything to correct this but to adjust it every week (every Monday specifically when I get to work to synchronize it with the employee time recorder). I don't wanna call seiko or amazon about this minor issue after I read one of the reviewers here wrote that seiko doesn't recognize amazon as one of their sellers of their watches.

Upon examining the costume, we noticed a few things. 1) the letter ""S"" was cracked and peeling off. 2) the Velcro on the back to keep the costume on was only on one side and not two, so it wouldn't close. I have attached pictures of the poor workmanship. My son and we were very disappointed in this costume. It's inexpensive in price and very cheap and put together poorly. I wouldn't buy this again at all. I don't recommend. For those looking for size comparison of this size small, my son is 5.3 years old and the small fits just fine.",1

A 9 is my size in everything...other boots, running shoes, etc. I have a completely normal size 9 foot. I could not fit my foot into the 8.5 in this boot. My advice would be to order your normal size, and disregard the tales of how big these run. BTW, I'd disregard the suggestions that you go to a store and try them on ""first,"" before ordering from Amazon. That is a sin. Amazon has a generous and easy return policy.

I am almost certain these are a knockoff. The logo didn't match the ones in the store. They felt cheap and had some side by side differences with ones I knew were real. My wife didn't like them. She took them to the local retailer who also said they believed them to be knockoffs. She did say that they do not always look the same so it could just be the model we had but they just didn't feel the same. We ended up returning then and buying the pair in the store. I gave them a 2 because I can't swear they are fake.,0

"Alright guys, whatever Converse or Amazon recommend in size just ignore. Buy a pair of converse in your regular size because I have bought two pairs already following this ""go a half size smaller"" rule and it has gone wrong for me both times as the shoes ended up being too tight on my feet. I bought these primarily for lifting, but on most days it hurts my feet to use. Anyways, went to me local Footlocker and tried a pair of Chucks in 10.5, my general size for shoes and it fit perfect. Maybe it's just me, but I have regular, narrow feet and they felt fine. So much more comfortable that I ordered a pair on Converse.com because Amazon didn't have my size and they seem to be taking longer than 2 days to get things to my house. What's up with that?Long story short I'm considering returning these.",1

The Dickies have an even smaller waist than my 34's!  Waste of money.",1
Maybe I got unlucky or maybe this isn't the real deal. It looked beautiful but after 2 weeks of use the stitching started to unravel across a third of the bottom making it unusable. I took it into a Fjallraven location and they were a bit hesitant because I had not bought it on their website but let me swap it for a new one. It must have been a rare mistake or a very good fake for the workers at the store not to be able to tell the difference. The one I received from the store looked the same but has lasted 3 years of school and travel and looks like it has minimal wear.,0
Product arrived damaged.  Closure was frayed and there was a large run.  Velcro not secured at all and fell off when I took the costume out of the bag.,0

"I washed these for the first time about a week ago prior to wearing. With other Wranglers I own of the same size, 40x30. First thing I noticed was the outer belt label was different, not the same as stretch denims bought in local western wear stores. They also seemed lighter, not the heavier material of others bought locally, all stretch denim. I wear Wrangler dress pants to work and they even seemed lighter than those. When I put them on for the first time they would not button, not even close. They seemed more like 36x30, at least two sizes smaller than all others I own, all 40x30. I checked the inside label, which was also different, but it said 40x30. Both labels do not look like the others, typical Wrangler logo labels. Looked cheaper. I honestly wondered if were ""fake"" Wranglers. I would definitly not buy again off Amazon. Sheplers, Cavendars, I would online, but these are not the same as the stretch denim I've purchased from those stores, in store and online. There's no reason every other of 8 pair of 40x30's fit perfect, these with different labels seem two sizes too small. Hung in the closet, likely give to Goodwill, tell them 36's mislabeled.",0
My new Merrel shoes wore a blister in my foot in less than an hour.They were somewhat small and yet too loose and rubbed a whole in my foot quick.The right fit better than the left....They must be 'seconds' or just a bad pair with something not right with them.I have owned 7 or more pairs of this same shoe and this pair is getting sent back with a big concern due to their terrible fit and odd feel.,1

DO NOT waste your time. GO to Walmart. They have all sorts of shoes that look like Sperry and Dockers etc etc for only 18.00.They fit perfect and are narrow which is what i need. These Sperry's I bought were too big for me with a 10 and too small with 9.5.They fit like crap TOO!! THE wal mart shoes are perfectly comfy. Also the leather on these Sperrys seem cheap and or fake.Quality has gone way down hill since my brother used to buy them all the time LONG AGO.Also places like Carnival or DFW shoe store are selling cheaper versions of the Sperry's but yet still selling them for 100.00 which should be illegal.My sister said they are probably making cheaper shoes for that store only to meet their price points . And those shoes are much cheaper but originals on here (amazon) are pretty cheap looking too. The Sperrys at DFW store did not have the Sperry name on the sole. And the leather seemed fake. So then why are they selling them for 100.00?You are crazy if you spend 100.00 or these shoes or anywhere else.,0

"Update: Both shoes have started squeeking as I walk. My previous Merrill's did not ever do this. My foot is a 8.5 Men.  These shoes are comfortable, but the constant squeeking ruins the relaxed walk.",1
"SUB-PAR Quality. After one week of wearing the shoes this is what they look like. The fake leather wore off immediately. Blue liner on the shoe on the right is an insole support.Dont waste your money. Do a Google search for those Australian work boots. I own a couple pairs of those as well, and they are far superior.",0
Got torn after a few minutes of wear.,1
"These shoes are fakes!!! Totally counterfeit! Do not buy!!! The tounge is  paper thin, the stitching is awful, and they even come in a knock off box. Real Nike shoes say made in China on the tag inside the tongue, these say made in Vietnam. There is no question that the shoes are counterfeit. And they are extremely expensive for what they are. I'd rather spend the extra $30 and get them straight from Nike and have a great pair of sneakers.",0
"These are completely fake.  First of all, mine had a Penmarc on the top of the left boot. And the tags inside are not fabric, and the QR code is not authentic. They are pretty darn good fakes but fake nonetheless. The worst part is I called Amazon and they are making me bring the return to a UPS drop off rather than having someone pick them up for me. I am completely rubbed the wrong way with these. Also the tag said they are made in Vietnam Ridiculous. And the outer ""skin"" is 2 different colors hahah",0

"I never expected to wear these as fulltime sunglasses. Hope everyone knows that sunglasses without UV protection are bad for the eyes, since the shades will dialate/open up your pupils and allow more UV into your eyes unprotected. Besides this, the glasses look the way they are advertised. Frankly I think these look pretty damn cool in a cheesy 1990's way. But I give 2 stars to the seller for not placing a warning on their product description about UV protection - not that I didn't know when purchasing.In summary, if you want something to protect your eyes, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. However, if you want to look like cool guy Rick Atsley without the protection, then these are for you.",1

"It is disappointing that these shoes run small.  I think the vendor needs to notify potential buyers ahead on their product description.  They are uncomfortable. I have purchased 6 pairs of shoes via Amazon and they are all true to their sizes.  When I ask to return them, I was told by the vendor that they need to charge restocking fee (?).  I am ok paying for the postage but seriously, they are charging restocking fee for a pair of shoes.  I have never been charged by Amazon for a restocking fee. The vendor says that they would waive it if I ask for an exchange.  Why would I do that when the shoes are badly fitting.  Do I run the risk of getting the wrong size again and pay for the postage AGAIN and at the end pay for restocking fee (?).  I would not buy from them again.",1
"I'm extremely disappointed that it took me 6 months to realize the pair of aviators I bought were fake. Honestly, the only reason I even realized this is because I recently bought an exact pair again (my original pair got stolen....funny now knowing whoever stole them, stole fake ones!) through Amazon and noticed they were a bit different from the ones I initially got. Out of curiosity I decided to check online to see if there were different types of the gold frame/crystal blue gradient lens, but instead I stumbled upon some of the reviews on here (which I probably should have read before purchasing my original pair) stating some were fake. After doing some online research and reviewing the original case, info pamphlet, and lens wiper given to me, I realized the ones I originally purchased were in fact replicas!For those of you buying these aviators, MAKE SURE the pair you are buying are being sold from Amazon, as these are authentic. However, if you see anything being ""sold by Lunettes4me fulfilled by Amazon,"" do yourself a favor and do not buy them. You will be wasting your money.",0
"After having them for about 9 months (ordered July 2016) I must report an issue that some other reviewers have mentioned.  The heels taper at the bottom for no reason I can see, which means your heel has less area of contact with the floor.  Think of them as something like a woman's high heel although not to that degree, of course.  This makes them prone to turning an ankle either inward or outward.  I thought I would get used to them, but even after this length of time, I still have issues with them.  The last straw was yesterday when I was simply walking into the kitchen.  My heel stepped on the carpet where it changes to a hard floor resulting in about a half inch lip. I turned my ankle and crashed into a cupboard with my face hitting first resulting in a bloody nose and a sprained left thumb.These shoes are DANGEROUS, and I'll NEVER wear them again!I also ordered the Jungle Moc Pro Grip Slip Resistant Work Shoe at the same time. These are similar to the Slip-On Shoe although I haven't worn them as much as the Slip-On's because they have developed a squeak when I walk.  I've tried talcum powder and it helps, but not for very long. I've read many glowing reviews on Merrell shoes, but all things considered, I'm going back to Redwings.",1

Baggy at ankles and color darker than expected. Will not buy again.,1
The fit isn't right. Not fitted to the waist. It's strange. Also the texture and what spouses like a print is not your tropical jeans look but yet not quality enough to pass for nicer jeans. In fact it looks a little like fake or imitation corduroy,0
"I really liked this watch in the beginning when I purchased in just under six months ago. But without wearing it every day, and not often using the light feature, it has stopped working. I don't know whether it is the battery or not, but the product description was that the battery had a long life. That has to be the shortest any battery has ever lasted in a watch I have owned.The strap is on the long side for my wrist, but if it had lasted, I could have ignored that.I am disappointed in the no return policy since I purchased it from Amazon, and had faith in their products.",1

"Compared to other fake cigarettes (puff or not), these are flimsy and nearly fall apart when you pick them up, much less put them in your mouth.

"This costume looks better in picture than it does in person.  The colors are kind of faded, not as vivid as in this picture.  I bought a large because it was the only size available, I'm more of a small size but it fits ok since it's a cape anyway.  As others have said, the head piece is completely useless, it's some very cheap foam material that doesn't hold its shape at all.  I purchased some other horns separately so that's what I will use with this cape.  I wish Disney would bring back maleficient and have more and better items available.",1
I bought these for my six year olds school shoes because kswiss were always my go to shoes.  I think my son is just as rough on his shoes as any other kid and the rubber soles are separating and the laces have frayed pretty badly.  I don't think I'll buy these again.,1

"I bought this for my 12 year old son for Halloween. The mask is not a complete mask. It only fits over the face and top part of the head, the entire back of his head is exposed. Now I'm not sure if it was meant to be that way or not, because it didn't even have the elastic string to hold the mask on his face either. The hair was a nappy mess and is made of some stuff that comes out by the hand fulls when trying to get it to lay down or at least look decent enough to wear outside. The knife is super fake looking. It's not even made of plastic like I expected, it's only good for probably children under 4. The jump suit was the only part I could use from this entire purchase. I ended up having to buy another mask and knife. I DO NOT recommend this unless for an extremely young child. Total waste of money.",0

So either every shoe I've ever worn has had it's sized fluffed to soothe my ego or this size 11 was meant for someone with gigantism. Overall the quality is good, the shoe seemed to be made quite well but I feel that whoever made this shoe mislabeled or vastly exaggerated its true fitment.",1

"I purchased this for my husband, who is prior military. I cannot describe, nor explain, how excited he was while waiting for this thing to come. Seriously, when the UPS guy pulled in front of the house my hubby ran outside like a school girl. The packaging opening scene that followed was something straight out of Christmas morning with small children. And then came the complaints. The hat is not a Condor hat, really, he made me go look at the condor site, and he is right it is not a Condor hat. The velcro thingies for patches are not the sizes listed in the product description on amazon. Apparently the camo is not genuine multicam, he keeps ranting there's pink in there, I don't know what this means, I just know the camo is not right. He dragged out his camelbac to illustrate the differences, as though I hadn't already gotten the point. Real condor hats are 100 percent cotton this thing isn't, but its product description says it isnt, so I don't know. The hat does seem rather cheaply made. If you are looking for a camo hat maybe this is the one for you. If you are purchasing this for a camo connoisseur or prior military be prepared for their letdown. I am returning this for a refund, though no one will be able to give me back the hours he is going to spend complaining about this hat.",1

The mask is a decent quality Halloween mask, but nowhere near what's shown in the photo!First, the skin shown is gray. (As well as the product description of what you just purchased!) What you get is green. The hair in the photo is clearly painstakingly hand-painted on with great precision. The hair on your mask is spray painted on by someone who clearly went to work drunk that day.The item shown may have been the original, but as we all know, when you continually make copies from copies, you end up with a poor impression of the original, at best!Amazon needs to at the very least, change the photo of this product to a more honest and accurate representation of what they are advertising!I'm going to have to call ""shenanigans"" on this one!!!",1

"I broke my original RayBan 3025 sunglasses that I paid over $200 for at Sunglass Hut. I broke one of the lenses and of course not able to find original lenses. As much I love this model, I decided to buy a new pair on Amazon as it seemed to be quite a bit cheaper. While being skeptical about authenticity, I placed an order. Sunglasses arrived just a little bit ago, prompt delivery by Amazon as promised. At first, everything seemed to be normal, RayBan packaging, cloth, brochures, G15 sticker etc.., but when I took the actual sunglasses out of the package, I noticed that the RayBan logo on the lens was missing. One of the temples was also bent a little bit, which i was able to straighten without too much of an effort. While straightening the temple, it felt like the metal was a little too thin/flimsy. I still have my original RayBans with a lens missing, so I compared the temple of my original ones to the ones from Amazon and the original one seems to be a lot thicker and not as easy to bend. I am pretty confident that if these sunglasses were original, RayBan manufacturing quality checks would not have let this product leave the plant. It is a little bit disappointing that I wasted a couple of days waiting for this product which ended up being a fake one but definitely something that I expected to see as these sunglasses were under $100 (do not recommend buying these from Reyan Sunglass). I guess I will be taking a trip to the Sunglass Hut again.",0

I really hoped these would work out...but they are very cheaply made.,1
If these shoes are a wide I'd hate to see a medium. Beware. If you have an even slightly wide foot these will not be the shoe for you. They are beautiful. Exactly what my husband was looking for and I was so excited to find them in a wide width. My husband has peripheral neuropathy and a wider size 14 foot. He can't wear just any shoe and finding 14 wides is near impossible. I'll have to continue my search for a comfortable wing tip because these are so narrow I don't think I could even wear them if they were in my size. Don't advertise a shoe as wide when it is narrower than narrow!,1
" I disappointed I opened package .The shoe worn used .I usually n't write review product , , I must clearly state shoe brand-new , unused , AND unworn !Do n't waste $ 50 used shoe get new shoe price .Do n't take chance used shoe sent .Save money !",0
"I ordered these boots from a horse and tack company and was impressed by the picture and title of EquiLEATHER paddock boot.  I received them in the wrong color (no biggie), but also saw they were not leather but vinyl! The company seemed so All-American in their advertising, but these plastic boots are made in China!  I called the company and they were very nice, but also informed me that Equi means ""fake leather""...and all this time I thought it meant EQUESTRIAN....as in HORSE!! It is afterall, a horse paddock boot!!  Not impressed, sent them back, still waiting for my account to be credited.",0

I was searching to save a penny and realized you get what you pay for.. These boots are certainly fake this are knock offs and I was very much distinguished. They are listed as being real when the fact is there fake. There is a real ugg displayed on the site but fake ones shipped out. The label is a different color from the real color which never changes. Buyers beware !!! Buyers beware Buyers beware !!!!!!,0

"I have worn this (supposedly) exact shoe for 2.5 years. I was very excited to find it at such an excellent price!  Unfortunately, it is not the same shoe.  It is made to look almost just like it.  The quality is no where near the original. (not Sketcher quality) The fit, support, sizing, width of the bands, etc, is just a little off. But, enough to make it completely different on my foot.  I believe I received a pair of fake Skechers.  I would like to file a complaint.",0

Their sizing goes in increments that follow the scale of 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. I am very disappointed that Amazon would advertise and sell fake merchandise. I will no longer buy anything 'name brand' from their site.",0

I am just glad that it was summer when I was wearing these, because I literally could not walk more than 2 feet before my dress was ""glued"" to my legs and getting shorter with every step.  I had to go to the ladies room to take the hose off and go bare legged.  (As an older lady, I prefer to wear hose, although I now it is more fashionable not to in the summer.)",1
"PLEASE BE CAREFUL. I bought 2 and had to return both because they were FAKE.One of them was clearly a badly made and the second one was just a better dupe. DO NOT BUY. I bought one for full price at Nordstrom and you can EASILY tell that both were fake.The better made fake bag even had the right tag, reflective patch, right zipper, but the biggest red flag was the poor stitching and the actual material. The REAL one has better stitching and the material is way thicker.One more thing, if you really want to see if it's a fake - splash some water on it. The real ones are made to be water resistant.It was such a waste of my time buying two thinking it was a good deal.Just pay the full price for the authentic one because it's better made and it's going to last longer!!",0

"I had ordered these boots because I had gotten the same pair in the past and they were great. When I got the pair from the Amazon website I was upset because these $100 boots had come packaged smooshed. It is making wearing them very uncomfortable. I was happy that the last pair had a brief, 1 day maybe, break-in period and they had lasted me a year. This pair is hard to wear even for a day without the squished structure of the boots digging into my foot and ankle. Quality boot, sad about the packaging/delivery/quality of my specific pair.",1

i wish i could give them negative 20 stars. I just received this costume today and I am sending it back today. I refuse to let my son parade in this horribly made mess. The shirt was tearing away from the jacket. the jacket is made of the cheapest material i have ever seen and cant possibly be called fake leather. I wasn't expecting leather but at least the costume in the picture had a little sheen on it to make it shine a little. the pants are too baggy and the jacket sleeves are too short. the hat looks like it is more fitting for a hobo costume because it looks dirty and is floppy and wrinkled. I wasn't expecting the greatest ever for the price but COME ON! Are you kidding me?!,0
It's a fake and no original Carrera. Never ever!,0

"Thanks you for asking for my opinion.  As you know, I returned the watch a few days after delivery for a full refund and was most impressed with the speed and hassle free nature of how you handle returns.  When I opened the watch package, I was greeted by three books and a computer disk.  I wanted a good looking watch (which it is) where I set the time and that's about it and instead I got a complex system that was very hard to understand, so to avoid further frustration, back it went.  It would have been helpful to know this was so much more than just a watch and was not for those without the ability to follow detailed and quite frankly hard to understand instructions.  As it was sealed, I never tried the computer disk.Best,Don",0
These are fake. I returned them for a refund.,0
"You get what you pay for.I own 2 pairs of Carrera Hot/S sunglasses that I bought from sunglass stores at the mall. I tried purchasing one from Amazon this time around from their seller, Sunglass Express, because they have the best price. I even had it shipped 2 days because I was so excited about it. When I received it from the mail, I realized I bought a fake version. You can tell from miles that this is fake. I have 2 originals to compare it to. The clearest indication was: it didn't have the iconic C-logo on the bridge! How did their QA miss this??? Next was the the Carrera logo on the lens. It was sloppily printed. Third was the serial number printed on the side. I took a pix of the serial number of the same glasses I found at the mall. That serial number did not match the one that was delivered to me albeit it is for the same style.I am returning this item. If I don't get a refund, I am reporting to Amazon to end this scam and reporting to my CC company to hold the transaction. I noticed that another reviewer claimed that they received a fake item while another disagreed. Whoever that person who disagreed must be affiliated to the seller and helping with the damage control. But trust me, this sunglasses is fake.",0
"I purchased a pair of the 513s because I had previously bought a pair of the 511s, which have Elastane and are very comfortable. When the 513s arrived, they were 100% cotton, contrary to what Amazon lists in the product description. For pants with a snug fit, Elastane is essential to comfort, otherwise they bind. I am returning these 513s with sadness. I actually like the cut better than the 511s because the bottom cuff is more relaxed and not as skinny as the 511s... but the Elastane is essential to either.",1

"I've been trying to find a replacement for the Goddess 1304.  Thought I'd try this bra because it seems similar enough. I'm not too impressed. I don't think this is a bad bra. I just don't think it suits my needs.  Here's why:I have back fat. I need to flatten said back fat. While it sort of did that, it created a whole new roll of back fat above the band. The band seemed be lower in the back. However, I compared it to my other bras and the band seems the same width and shape, so I don't know.  I didn't have the luxury of trying before I bought.  Admittedly, the issue might just be that I bought a size too small. Just mentioning it in case any other women with a similar body issue were thinking of purchasing. If you can, definitely try before you buy to make sure.My main issue, however, is the straps. They just don't get tight enough. I shortened them as much as they would go, and it just wasn't enough.  I was visibly sagged in the front. If I can reach up and tighten straps with my hands and lift my girls, it's not a good thing. I didn't think it was very supportive. If you need a tighter strap to keep yourself up, I would not go with this bra.",1

Absolutely inexcusable. How am I supposed to wear a costume that smells like that?  If you told me that California Costumes doubled as a fish cannery, I would totally NOT be surprised.  It's hard enough to find a decent costume that actually LOOKS like the picture, but now I'm supposed to smell like rotting fish on halloween.  THANKS FOR NOTHING CALIFORNIA COSTUMES!!",0

"Is definitely our knock off Ray bands from China and not from ray-Ban Chyna manufacturing location either. Took a month for them to get to us and when we took them into the Ray-Ban store they identified them as fake. They do not have the etching on the glass of the RB logo, nor are they fully polarized and the screws are made of cheap metal. The Ray-Ban is also a sticker not painted on the Lens! I have bought fake Ray-Ban's from overseas and only pay $20 which I'm fine with but when you pay full price and can go to sunglass hut for the same amount can get a guaranteed warranty that's what I would suggest. Ray-Ban will not fix these glasses if they break even though they say that they are authentic. I have contacted Amazon and reported this issue will see if they stay online, buyer just beware!",0

My husband and I have been wearing converse since we were children so naturally when we had our own children that's what they want to wear. Over the years we have noticed their quality go down hill however we stuck with them since our whole family loves the style. I ordered 2 pairs in February for my son and I and noticed today that the sole has separated on his. He's not an overly active kid and even if he was I'd expect them to last more than 2 months.  Extremely disappointed!,1
"As soon as I opened it out of the packaging, the plastic reeked terribly. Once we got over the smell and tried to inflate it, we realized that it had a leak which kept getting bigger. The seams are very flimsy. My 4 year old son has been talking about dressing up as Buzz for Halloween and insisted on the jet pack. He's going to be so disappointed when I tell him that it doesn't work. This toxic piece of junk is headed straight for the landfill. Would definitely not recommend this accessory. ",1

"My very-standard-size US drivers license does not fit in the ID section!  The stitching is so poor, in the area that holds credit cards, that some cards went very deep into the pockets and others stuck out out of the pocket so far that cards can not be viewed. (The cards are  supposed to sort of cascade (for lack of a better word) in such a way that the top of each card can be seen and the desired card can be readily pulled out.)  When the wallet is snapped shut the change purse pops open!  (Oops, all my coins on the floor!)  The area for currency is very deep making it difficult to see and draw out US dollars - although it might be suitable for non-US currency.  The exterior leather is acceptable but the interior vinyl is cheap and does not seem as though it will wear well. It is so bad I wonder if it is a knock-off because Buxton products are usually fine.  I was very dissapointed and am returning it.",1

I should have known better after reading some of the other reviews but I gave it a try anyway.  I don't like the pointy look of this bra or really anything about the look at all.  It may give good support but I wouldn't want to wear it under anything even slightly see through because of the huge band.  It is definitely not what I was looking for.  The search continues...,1

"I really should have taken the advice of others but decided I wanted to see for myself if these Ray bans were the real deal because of the overwhelmingly positive feedback. Let me put an end to this debate once and for all. Theres a reason these bans cost 80 as opposed to 130. They are of poor quality and possibly fake. I bought a pair of exact same ray bans from sunglass hut and one from amazon as the seller and did a side by side comparison. The differences were evident. The ones from amazon had lenses that were loose and moved around which was annoying and felt cheap. The frame was not evenly leveled when placed on a flat surface and overall felt lighter. The frames made a squeaky sound evrytime I folded them. As far as these being fake, I am not sure. They passed most of the important checks but the one anomaly that I noticed was the words in the inside of the frame was alot closer to the hinges as opposed to the real ones from sunglass hut.My conclusion is these are either really good fakes or of extremely poor quality and should never have left the manufacturer's factory. Im assuming most people either cant tell the difference between good and bad quality and thats why the reviews are good or maybe im one of the few that got unlucky and was sent a bad pair. Amazon is outstanding when it comes to returns so if u want to see for yourselves go right ahead or you can pay extra and ensure you have authentic ray bans of high quality",0

"I was surprised of how small the size of these products! I normally purchased the same product individually at the store and they only cost $8 for the weight of 6oz per bottle, which means for $24 you will get total of 18oz (3 bottles@6 oz). The product description doesn't mention the size of each bottle, and its actual size is ONLY 4oz/bottle!I am wondering of why the seller didn't put the detail description of the product??? On the picture it looks like they have a decent size, but they are actually much smaller than what you can find in a store!I am also not sure of what the brushes are for, especially the one with rectangular, plain side.IT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF!",1

"I ordered a 3x-4x because I have a large backside and I'm normally a 16-18 nowadays. They seemed to fit fine at first, but after about two hours of wearing them and probably 20 minutes of walking around, the ""control top"" part of the pantyhose proceeded to dig into my crotch. 10 minutes later, after adjusting them several times, they started to pinch and burn so badly I had to leave the store and go home to change immediately. I could barely walk, and every movement hurt. After a day of applying baby powder liberally, I came to realize that the pain in my thighs was actually a second degree burn, complete with blisters and a very painful heat rash that I still have a week later. It still hurts a lot to walk, as I naturally have no thigh gap. I attached a picture from two days after the burn.Don't buy these. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but it is not acceptable if even only 1% of people who use these pantyhose get second degree burns.",1

Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this.

Just looking at it now, im realizing it has been at the same time for the past day...  very dissapointed.",1

"When I tried this on, I was confused how anyone could possibly pull the neck hole on over their head. I almost ripped it pulling it on, and it felt like the neck was so tight it was choking me. Upon close inspection, it looks as though a side of the black neck fabric had accidentally (I assume) gotten sewn to the purple collar when it was sewn on. Easily fixed by cutting those few threads, but very shoddy quality. The horns with attached black collar ruffles are a joke: too small, terrible quality, the black collar looks like it emerges from your jaw bone, not the base of the neck as it should. But I had read others reviews here and purchased better horns separately anyway. And finally, the pink stripes down the front are PINK, seriously, BRIGHT HOT PINK. Wish they had just omitted those stripes altogether.Based on how poor the quality was, how thin the fabric (almost sheer), and you have to buy better, additional horns separately, I am surprised at how many people rated this product so highly. As Halloween approaches, the cost of this item keeps increasing and is now way over priced for what you get.",1

"As others have noted this strap is too short and unless your wrists measure less than 7 inches around I strongly recommend not using this product. In order just to wear it the strap will generally need to be completely removed from the ""non-permanent"" side and then re-threaded back through. There's no way this is ""over-the-sleeve. The problem is that if one has to replace the original watch band a kit from Suunto is required in any case.  If you can somehow just get a hold of the attaching (small shallow c-shaped items illustrated) you could attach those and get a strap to feed through those and be set. Additionally, in order to detach/reattach the band two very small screwdriver type instruments are needed and it's still not easy.  This band is NOT elastic and does not stretch.  Read and heed. The materials and workmanship are not of high quality.  My 2-star rating is generous.",1

"I am a fool. I read the reviews regarding how poorly made these jewelry armoires were and did not listen because it is the only large armoire I could find with the kind of earring storage I wanted and I currently own a smaller SEI jewelry box and, though it is obviously not high-end, it is well constructed. The price was okay and seriously, how bad could it be!?Amazon shipped out super fast and it was well packaged. I took it out and noticed right away that the finish was cheap. The cherry color is pretty fake looking and a little too red for my tastes. And it was noticeably sloppy in a couple areas. Alright, it's not beautiful... but it's going in my closet, so I decided to assemble it anyway and give it a chance. I'm pretty handy... maybe a few adjustments and it would be fine.The legs went on perfectly, so far so good. Upon standing the thing up, however, I noticed that the doors did not align properly. I figured this might be due to a few screws not being tightened all the way, so I checked and actually the screw holes are already stripped from the doors pulling away during shipping... you'd have to add wood putty to get them to stay. Doable, but what a pain. And upon closer examination, the hinges themselves seemed pretty flimsy... not a good sign.Next I checked the earring racks. The design on these is really cool and it is a darn shame this is so poorly made. Each earring rack swings forward so you can get easy access to your earrings. Also, they used slits instead of holes so you can easily slide your earrings onto the racks which is especially nice for post earrings. BUT each rack is installed un-evenly which means some of the magnets that hold them in place are too powerful and some don't work at all. Not fixable.On to the drawers. They are small. And they smell bad. I'm guessing from the glue. 2 of the drawers had small rips in the liners and 3 of them had uneven glueing. Again: sloppy. And the liners are so thin, that would not be an easy fix. I'd have to replace them entirely. None of the drawers have stops and they come out all the way pretty easily. Except for the bottom drawer... couldn't get that one to open. Turns out it's stuck on the mounting hardware underneath. Meh.Perhaps if I'd gotten this on Craigslist for $50... or as a gift from someone else, I wouldn't be so disappointed. It is certainly functional and if you get really lucky and end up with one without all of the assembly sloppiness, it would be okay. But given the reviews I've seen here combined with my own experience, it's a gamble. So, for how much I paid... I think it should have been in far better shape. It's going back.",0
Plastic. I wouldn't bother with it.,1
"Update after 3 months of moderate to heavy use (1-2 hours per day on average):The upper has begun separating from the rubber at the toe of the shoe, allowing water to easily get in. It has become so bad that water wets my socks from a walk through a field with morning dew. When I received these, I noticed that there was only a small amount of glue that appeared to hold the rubber outsole to the upper at the toes and it looked pretty precarious. But, I figured that these were Merrell's and they would hold up. I expect more from Merrell and I expect more from an $80 shoe. They are still comfortable, but I am now pretty much restricted to using them indoors only. Based on the other reviews being overwhelmingly positive, I think this defect may be limited to the camo version.Otherwise, this is a nice shoe:Unlike neoprene versions (e.g., Bogs), these slippers are extremely breathable. They keep your feet comfortably warm in the cold (even in single digits), but they don't sweat. To me, there is no worse feeling than your feet shedding sweat nonstop because they can't breathe in your shoes. I will gladly trade the lack of complete waterproof-ness for breatheability. This breatheability also means that these are fine to wear in the summer, whereas those made from neoprene will be unbearably hot.These come in half-sizes. Many similar outdoor slippers do not, which can be a big deal if you wear a half-size. I am an 11.5, not a 12. I walk out of 12s and 11s scrunch my toes. Merrell is smart enough to realize that skipping out on half-sizes will make many people unable to wear these.These slippers are extremely comfortable and easy to slip in and out of. You can feel the cushioning as you walk -- it is firm, but cushioned -- exactly what I want in an outdoor slipper. They provide great traction and grip on all outdoor surfaces, including snow- and ice-covered surfaces.",1

"I was super excited to get this ring. I found them so beautiful and was so excited to wear something like this. I'm a little rough on my rings and I wanted to get something that was durable and pretty at the same time. The ring I got was missing one of the side stones. So I called Titanium Kay and they were quite helpful. I sent it back for no cost and they sent me a replacement which I got in a few days. They were helpful. And I started to wear it immediatly. I'm the kind of girl that forgets to take her rings off for.. anything so they get wear and tear. The problem I found with these rings is that the finish came off. And it wasn't just tarnished, I tried to clean them but nothing made a difference. The silver began to crack in places and you could see black in the cracks and then the rest of it where my fingers touched it began to fade towards black. I stopped wearing them because when people looked close they looked really fake and cheap once they started to tarnish.Initially I was impressed by the product but in the end I was disappointed.",0

"Be warned: These Triathlon watches look very sleek, but replacing the band (at least on mine) is much harder than before. If you can't get it on, you no longer have a wearable watch.First, the store where I've been buying replacement bands doesn't even carry one for this model (apparently because they're too hard to swap out). So instead of having it done, free, while I wait, I had to buy one online from Timex with a week for delivery. And then put it on.Mine arrived this morning. I usually pop the old one off and the new one on with a knife blade in five minutes. After prying the old one off, I was applying so much pressure on the new one's spring bar that it was becoming literally dangerous. The pin hole is so tiny and the fit so tight that after 15 minutes I finally gave up before I slashed myself.I'll try again later, but I suspect I may have to take it to a store and pay them to install itif they can or will. If I have to buy a new watch, it won't be a Timex, ever.",0

I am not sure if the product was a fake, but either the quality of Ray-Ban have drastically deteriorated over the pst few years or the product was not authentic. impossible for me to tell, but although I happily paid even more for my first pair, I would not pay more than 150 dollars for the product I got this time.",0

"Updated below.I have been wearing Justin 3133s almost daily for over 30 years.  First to school and on the ranch as a work boot, and then as a uniform boot.  When I first buy them, I write the date in them, and then I would write the date in them every time I had a new sole put on them.  Well that was back when they were worth having repaired.  Today they're like most everything else.  The quality is out the window and you throw them away.  The proof is that I still have 3133 Ropers that are dated from high school in the 80s.  Ever since they moved the operation to Mexico, the stitching blows out LONG before the soles wear through, and then if you try to get them repaired the leather won't hold, plus they have to get deeper bite which makes them fit tighter than before.  In Justin's ultimate wisdom they now have what they CALL a Roper that is American made, but it's not the 3133.  It's a different leather that doesn't shine up well for a uniform boot, they fit differently so you'll likely wear a different size, and it has a contrasting color stitching around the top.  The two stars is for Justin's commitment to quality.  If you need a plain black cowboy boot that is pretty comfortable just buy them, put a little liquid nails on them when they start blowing apart, and then toss them and go buy another pair.Hey Justin:  How about bringing the original 3133 back to America to be made, and send that two bit imitation Roper down there?Update:  I changed my rating from two stars to one star as they have gotten even worse.  I really planned to do my first ever video review, but it seems I never have the time.As I stated above, I write the date in my boots the first time I wear them.  I didn't start wearing these until the end of March 2014, and these were just going to be a pair of non-work boots that I just kept nice and wore to the office.  Additionally, that means that I don't wear these everyday.  Then a few weeks ago at the end of December 2014, I was walking in on a rainy day and notice my foot was wet.  I looked down and the stitching had already blown out on the inside of one of the boots.  Then a week or so later I noticed it had blown out on the other boot as well.It's also important to note that these boots have never even needed to be polished!  They've been worn occasionally to the office, for 9 months, and have been so lightly worn that they're not even scuffed.  The soles still have plenty of leather on them, yet the stitching has blown out.After almost 4 decades I'm abandoning Justin and have purchased a pair of Lucchese Ropers.  They look essentially the same as the Justin 3133s and cost more at the time of purchase, but they're MADE IN THE U.S.A. and from what others have told me they'll last me many times longer than the Justins.  Therefor over the long haul perhaps I'll actually save money.",1

I originally bought this for my mannequin to use for photos in my online jewelry shop.

If anything, they run large (the fingers are extraordinarily long), so don't be tempted to ""size up.""",1

The heart and clock itself is made of the same plastic material like those cheap Halloween masks that have a little elastic to hold it on your head.  It is hollow on the back side and so you get just half a heart. It is not a full three dimensional item. If you cut two eye holes in it, you could turn it into a Halloween mask.  I don't know of a better product for a better price, which moved me from one star to two. With more time, I would have made a heart for my costume.",1
"I read the reviews (both the bad and the good) before purchasing these sunglasses. After visiting a nearby Sunglasses Hut and loving how these cool shades looked on me, I decided to buy these sunglasses. I bought them from Amazon because it had the best deal at 40% off.The free shipping took a week and it was packaged well. When I received it at night, everything looked right. I then watched videos on youtube on telling the authenticity of ray bans. And this is a VERY GOOD REPLICA. The logos are all in the right places, the etching is on the left len, the case is hard in the front, the booklet and cleaning cloth are included.Yet, as other reviewers had mentioned, the quality of these are noticeably sub-par, to say the least. They creak whenever you fold or unfold them.I also tried these on outside and inside. They lens are not like the ones on the pair that I tried on at sunglasses hut. I am returning this and will buy an authentic pair.However, I gave this two stars because one could not tell that it's fake simply by looking at it and it's $50 cheaper.**I hope Amazon looks into this but this will probably not happen...disappointed.",0

"This is the second time I purchased this watch for my boyfriend. His first one lasted about two years until the strap broke. I came on Amazon and clicked ""buy again"" so he could have the same exact watch. This second one that we received looks very similar, almost identical. However, there are two major differences.1. Nowhere on the watch does it actually say Timex. It looks exactly the same as the first one, same buttons, color, writing on the front and back. However, this new one does not say Timex on the front faceplate nor on the back plate. It's a fake.2. The new one does not have the countdown timer. This is the whole reason I purchased this watch again, because he likes to use the countdown timer for when he is swimming and working out. This watch does have a stopwatch, and an alarm function, but not a countdown timer.This is a great product when they actually send out the real thing. We are very disappointed that they sent us a fake. I've never rated something one star, I hope I never have to do this again.",0

Not worth what I paid for themThe sole was almost as bad. Cheap, cheap, cheap.And the height--I ordered these because I thought they were taller than normal boots--WRONG. Just like the other pair I own, which I was NOT hoping for. Most likely, I should have measured more accurately, because the height is given in the product description.Bottom line: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE.

Also, when I tested the UV absorption using lab equipment, it blocked only 20% of UVC light. These types of fakes will lead to severe eye damage because they force your eyes to dilate by blocking a lot of visible light, but then they let in most of the UV light that causes damage to the retina and causes cataracts.  Avoid these!",0

"As far as the costume itself, it was fine and what you would expect.  But for size, ""standard"" must mean 5'8"" and below.  I'm not that big, 6' tall and thin...but since the costume is a one piece jumpsuit style...when i tried to pull it over my shoulders it was way too tight in the crotch area.  That's all the details i'll say on that.  I thought of reordering and despite seeing a size chart, i didn't see any way to select the size i wanted.  (maybe i missed that option).  I basically cut the costume in half and modified it myself.  it worked for this yr, but that will probably be it.  The one downfall of ordering on-line...sizes.  Better luck to you.By comparison...the scarecrow costume i ordered at the same time also said 'one size fits most' actually fit me (but my wife used it).",1
"I had two pairs of Havaianas in my life, and both lasted me for years (and probably thousands of miles!). After my last pair finally died, I decided bite the bullet and order some at amazon. What a mistake! I don't know if amazon is selling fakes, or if the brand has totally cheapened its line, but what I received was the equivalent of the ever-popular $3 flip-flops from Old Navy. Instead of the high-quality durable rubber I know from my previous Havaianas, the ones I received were cheap, flimsy, and foamy. They broke right away, because after a few steps the knob on the bottom of the sole that holds the toe straps slipped through the flimsy foam material. When I took a step into a small puddle, the foam just soaked up the water, which I then had to listen to getting squeezed out--squish, squish--as I kept walking like on a pair of soapy sponges strapped to my feet. You shell out the cash for Havaianas because you want serious, indestructible rubber soles, not for some waste product you can now buy at IKEA for $1 (no joke). Don't buy these is you want something that lasts. And even if you just want some single-use item to stick in the pail at your wedding so that high-heelers can give their feet a break, then don't buy these either--you get those much cheaper at Old Navy (or IKEA, for that matter).",0

I have had over 20 merrell mocs.  These have some kind of high arch that is around the heel area.  Just wore them Friday and Saturday I had big time pain in my inside of my heels.  Feels swollen and bruised.  Too late to send back.  Never had this problem before.  Now feet hurt to put in my other merrells.  Something is just not right with shoe.  I thought they were knock offs but then I went to a shoe store and low and behold even those have the arches starting in the heel area.  Thought maybe I just had a wierd foot all of a sudden.  Nope - had others try it and they all mentioned that it felt lumpy.  I emailed merrell and all they did was sent me a general form about returning to the merchant or to them if it was defective.

The stamp, as others mentioned, was not the same style as my old pair, which I purchased in store at Nordstroms.  The length of the sandals was about half a size bigger. It's still very well made, but for $90 bucks, I don't want maybe fake sandals.  I ended up returning them and repurchased from zappos, which didn't have the 20%, but at least I know they're genuine and will last me a few years.  FYI, the pen marks (e.g., 6M) are just how they make them, and the pair I ordered from Zappos also said made in Mexico.  So I guess they're having factories overseas now.",0

"I have purchased Buxton products in the past and have been very pleased, however, this purse is total junk.  The design of the purse is awesome, it has a place for everything, however, the quality is horrible.  The snap on each of the two flaps is really tight, which is a good thing, however, the material holding the snaps is a super cheap vinyl and in spite of my trying to be ever so careful when I opened the flaps, the vinyl gave before the snap would open and tore the entire snap attachment from the body of the bag.  Since I loved the design of the purse so much I thought maybe I could ""fix"" it by just removing the snaps and putting a magnet in it's place but I guess the magnet wasn't strong enough and the flap kept popping open.  In addition, the straps connect at the back of the purse, tipping the purse forward toward the flaps, making it ""front heavy"" so when you would pick up the purse without the front flap being fastened, everything would dump out of the purse.  I have never, ever written a bad review about anything, but this one was soooo bad, I had to make an exception.  I didn't expect a whole lot because the purse was very inexpensive, but I did expect that it would last longer than 5 days.  This purse is the perfect example of ""you get what you pay for"".  If this purse was made with quality closures and material, it would be a knockout, because the interior layout is perfect.",1

I'm a girl that wears a size 10 and to wear  oversized shoes means I dive head first into ""clowndom"" so I have to tighten them really tight which ruins the shape of the shoes.Would have returned them but I was catching a flight and the shoes arrived just as I was about to leave and those were the shoes I planned to wear. Now I'm whatever dollars down in the hole. I might be giving them away as gifts to a male friend. I only wore them twice. Had to wear pants to hide my shame both times.",1

Compared the exact same type of Clarks shoes I bought from ""Clarks"" website, this site's shoes are so cheaply made.  I believe this site sold the fake ""Clarks"" !  It does not fit and also the material used to make shoes are rough and not well made. They are definitely not the other real Clarks shoes should be. Definitely should not buy it! I was busy at the time when the shoes arrived so I missed the return date. I regret this purchase. I have loved the Clarks shoes for more than 20 years.  It is the first time I regretted on buying Clarks shoes.",0

"I bought this as a replacement for my go-to wallet of the same name.  This is a newer version I don't like for these reasons:1) coin purse is divided and deep - hard to get coins out of quickly.  I tried to keep only pennies in the front one - otherwise not sure for the divided coin purse.2) HATE THIS PART:  Undivided DEEP place for bills!  Maybe this makes it harder for thieves, but it is harder for me, too!  I have to take all of the bills out every time I buy something! Very non-user friendly!3) Metal part of coinpurse compartment is squared off and sharp.  Old version was rounded.Positives:  Driver's license compartment is easier to remove and replace in wallet.  No plastic photo billfold (never used it or it fell out before).  More compartments for credit cards, gift cards, etc.The wallet looks the same as the older version in the picture and has the same name.",1

Not too tight to get on, but definitely a bit more snug than I would have expected. If you're between sizes, you may wish to size up. I'm not between sizes at all and I initially wondered if I should have sized up! As I put them on further and further up my leg, I could tell the color was just not working for me at all. It was pretty clear I was wearing them and they were a weird shade that was too light while also looking a bit chalky. I'm super fair so this was highly unexpected, if anything I thought these might be a bit dark! The material wasn't even on me all the way or even for a full two minutes, yet when I took it off, it was clearly stretched out and I know they wouldn't be any good for a second wear especially if I had worn them for the evening. They are very thin and fragile; runs seem inevitable very quickly.",1

"while this watch is very pretty, it is not completely as described. It does look like the picture. I am not happy with my purchase.THIS IS THE EMAIL I SENT THE SELLER:My husband purchased this for me in feb of this year. He bought this watch because it was water resistant. Over the last few months I have showered, swam, and washed dishes with this watch on. It seemed to always have water under the crystal. Recently I got around to taking it to my local jeweler because I thought that I was responsible for damaging this product. Possibly knocking loose the crystal and allowing water intrusion. After my jeweler inspected my piece, I was informed that this watch is not water resistant in any way. The product description says that it is. I am very unhappy with this outcome. I am now having to pay to have this watch serviced at my local Fossil store to repair the rust on the inside and remove the water. The product description says that it is water resistant up to 50 meters. I have not, in any way, taken this watch nowhere near this depth. I have only swam with it once. This watch has never been more than 3 ft deep. I am not happy with the fact that this product description is misleading. I wanted a watch that I would NOT have to take off to shower or wash dishes. Your return policy states that I am unable to return the product because I do not have all of the original packaging materials or the original box. I want someone to contact me regarding my purchase and what can be done to remedy this situation. I would not have purchased this watch had the item description been correct and told me that this watch is not water resistant at all.",1

It might look better in another color, but the rose red (shiny and somewhat glittery) made it look plastic-y and cheap.  I've had this shoe before in the oiled leather version, and I loved it because it looked solid and rich (not in cost, but in appearance).  This one . . . no thanks.",0

"My son has been wanting to be Superman since before Christmas of last year - he even wanted me to buy him a costume for Christmas, but I held off until October. We had our church's Harvest Festival on October 30th and the thing was bothering him so much. The cape is held together by velcro, but the tabs go out from the edge of the cape, so the harder material of the velcro irritated his neck. Then I realized that the straps that keep the ""boots"" in place are also velcro and not one solid piece. They kept separating as he walked so we gave up. When he took off the costume, the velcro came off in 3 places on those boot ""straps"" The front tip of one of the feet looked like someone had snipped it with scissors because there was a piece of foam showing.Today (October 31st) we went to a trunk or treat event and he wore the costume again. I had to physically sew the boot straps together so that they would stay in place. My son is not hard on his clothes and doesn't play rough at all due to low muscle tone, but just bending down to put on shoes caused him to get a hole in the knee. He also saw little holes that showed up in the arms. This costume was really a piece of junk and a total waste of my money. I knew I should have looked a little harder and bought something at Walmart or Target. I will never buy a costume off of Amazon again (hopefully, I'll remember this comment next year).",1

There isn't much of an arch support either.Also, I agree they run large. I wear a 10 - 10 1/2 normally.

"I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want to bring down the rating of the actual product, but this might help someone else so...I've been traveling a lot lately and really wanted a new backpack because mine is so uncomfortable. Saw a bunch of guys at the airport wearingFjallraven Kanken Classic Backpacks and I fell in love with the design so I checked them out on Amazon as soon as I got home. Saw that a lot of people were getting fakes, but I figured that it wouldn't happen to me. People usually sell fakes for way less than what the real product is worth, and I was paying $75 for my backpack... so surely I was getting the real deal, right? WRONG.I was appalled when I opened up the package of my brand new $75 backpack and noticed that it looked like something you'd get from the dollar store. Whoever faked this went through great lengths to make it look like the real thing, all of the zippers had the right designs and initials... the tags were printed in the right colors and with the correct text, it even had the swedish flag thing. But some things did stick out as obviously fake. I hope that this will help you guys:- the dimensions were slightly off, smaller than the classic pack but bigger than the mini.- the canvas of the backpack feels really flimsy, like a cheap backpack.- there were a lot of frayed strings, both inside and outside- the stitching is clumsily done- the paint on the zippers is already chipping- packing was Chinese (dead giveaway) -- item was shipped from the US so there is no reason for it to be in Chinese- has some tags that are written in Chinese (dead giveaway)edit: seller was Audrey Stork",0

"These shoes are probably not real, which is not even the worse part. The thing is, I have Toms that are fakes that lasted me longer than these did. Yet, somehow I managed to pay almost full price for these rip-offs. That can be the only explanation because I wore these shoes for about three or four months about three times a week and within about two months, the backs were tearing off. The sole and fabric were tearing apart and they became basically useless in any wet weather (not that you should wear Toms in the rain). Anyway, long story short, it's ridiculous anyway to pay $40+ for canvas shoes in the first place but the ones on Amazon are probably some of the worst shopping decisions I've made. Honestly, go out and buy some off-brand ones somewhere else and they'll last you longer than getting these slightly less expensive ones.",0

"I chose this boot because I was trying to stay away from boots that feature characters from television shows or movies and I thought that the cinch on top will help keep out the water when my son jumps into puddles. However, there is no string to adjust and instead there is a narrow elastic band wrapped in the grey waterproof fabric. It was easy enough to put my son's feet in the boot but forget about tucking his pants in and after an hour with the tight elastic on his leg he had a red mark that took hours to fade away. This useless and pain causing elastic band took the place of the bucket handles which are pretty handy. Returned for refund.Delivery was prompt and the refund process easy, hence the 2 stars.",0

I took it to the jewelry store to have it welded shut, only to discover it wasn't real gold so it couldn't be closed without making a very noticeable burn mark. Lastly, the cost is too high for a fake piece of jewelry. Not a child friendly product.",0

There's enough extra material you could make another hat out of it.The funny thing about all of this is I've got a big head. lolSo should you spot somebody at the airport trying to get on-board a plane wearing one of these, run because he's probably got a bomb under it since there's so much room.",0

"One star because advertised attributes do not match the product description.I own this, my fiance bough it for me here on Amazon.  The first ring that arrived had a scratch.  In my opinion, the scratch was acquired during manufacturing.  No big deal, we returned it and re-ordered a new ring.The new ring arrived just fine.  I'm very happy with it and will keep it because I like it and because it's from my future wife.  I would give this item 5 stars if it measured 6mm and was 12 grams.  The descriptions are incorrect, and you the potential buyers should be aware of this.  Many of you wouldn't even think about doing what I did:I put the ring on a digital scale (high accuracy and properly calibrated) and the weight is 11.63 grams. why would a ring weight less that 12 grams?, well, the next measurement was with a digital caliper, again, high accuracy, calibrated etc.. etc..  The width is NOT 6mm as advertised but rather comes in at 5.71mm.  I took 4 readings(12, 3, 6, 9 o'clock positions), they were: 5.72, 5.72, 5.71 and 5.68mm.  Prior to using a caliper, I casually put the ring against a high quality metric ruler and it was clear that it wasn't quite 6mm.  Caliper measurements confirmed this.These small, deviations from the advertised numbers explain why the price is much lower that from other makers where you have same attributes (weight and width).  In all honesty, the price of this ring is fantastic compared to rings that are a full 6mm width and weigh a proper amount.  The measured differences are tiny, but they explain the reason for this excellent price/value.I'm of the opinion, that these rings are those that do not pass the internal quality by Benchmark (the maker).  Benchmark makes high quality products and you can see them at their stores.  I believe that this specific product are those rings that simply would not be sold in the store WITH the lifetime warranties.  They do not hold up to the high quality standard Benchmark sells in their stores with the lifetime warranty.Having said all this, I understand all these things and reasons why the ring's price is what it is.  I'm totally fine with the VALUE of this ring.  but only because I understand exactly what I have.  Perhaps some of you would feel that you did not get what you really wanted.  So, make your own decisions, take your own measurements.BTW, I completely agree with another comment here about Benchmark vs. Tiffany...",1

"I was a big fan of the Brooks addiction 7 but unfortunately they have stopped offering them. So I tried the ""BEAST"" the minute I put it on -- it just did not feel right-- but I decided to go for a run and test it that way. Once I finished running both my knees were hurting (which I never had this problem with the addiction 7). Now this problem could be because of my supination (for some people the opposite angle which is pronation) and this shoe is not made or designed to account for these problems. I did not have a heart to return it because I felt some poor soul would end up with a used shoe-- so I kept it in a hope that someday I might be able use it as a walking shoe. So I give it a 2 based on my own experience. Now I have tried the addiction 8 and it appears that even though in my opinion this is not as good as 7, however, it has been perporming well so far.",1

"These just arrived.  I selected the 'Sold and Shipped by Amazon' glass since other reviewers were claiming that the glasses they received were potentially counterfeit.  I don't know enough about Ray Ban's to determine if they are in fact fake, however I can tell that these are incredibly poor quality.  One side of the glasses is much higher than the other. When placed on a flat table, one side of the glasses is up in the air about 1 inch while the other side is flat against the table top. Needless to say, they look incredibly slanted on my (or anyone's) face.  I can't believe these passed Ray Ban's quality testing if in fact these are genuine.",0
"After reading reviews with various descriptions of these bandanas, I decided to take a chance and order them. Big mistake. I am looking for real, regular ol cotton bandanas. In the product ""details"" section, it states the bandanas are made of 100% cotton. However, when they arrived, they are clearly polyester and labelled as such. I looked back at the product description online and noticed in the ""product features"" section, they are stated as being polyester. So I guess I can only blame myself for buying these cheap things. It's clearly misleading to have them stated as cotton and polyester. They are very skimpy, low thread count, polyester, printed on one side only. Do noy buy these if you want a REAL bandana.",1

Nice glasses that fit well and are very comfortable to wear.Update:I had noticed the lenses on these glasses scratched very easily. When comparing them to my previous pair, it became rather obvious that the Amazon ones were fakes. I took the lenses out and these are flimsy plastic lenses while the real Ray Bans are heavier glass lenses with better coatings that don't get scratched. Looking through them is like night and day! They initially fooled me but these are definitely fake Ray Bans. Not too happy to have spent so much for poor quality fakes!",0

"This item was a fake! I'm pretty bummed out as I purchased this with the assurance that the item Ships from and sold by Amazon.com. when I ordered it. I was invoiced by Amazon LLC/ Amazon Export Sales Inc. Upon reviewing this in greater details, I realized that this is a really good fake. Passes most tests, but 3 things gave it away: the case, the plastic-like finish of the gold, and the upside down R-B logo on the nose pad. Amazon says this item is now Item Under Review as being not the way it was described - a clear tell all that this item is a fake. P.S. Amazon is showing that this item is being sold by MagentaShop obviously with absolutely no needback.",0

"I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday.  He absolutely loved it out of the box but within weeks the black started chipping off the band and then the mesh band was actually unraveling.  It unraveled so much that at one point there were stray wires poking out that actually cut both of us.  I contacted the company about 5 weeks after he started wearing it and was told that I had to ship (at my own expense) to get it repaired under warranty.  After about 5 months of silence I finally get an email that says, please send us 35 dollars for a new band and another 4 for shipping.  The guy on the phone (from dreamshopee, Amazon vendor) was practically screaming at me on the phone.  Either these watches are so delicate that they can't be worn for daily life or this guy is running a scam and selling fake watches.  He called me from a New Jersey number and as a NY resident I told him I'd just come and pick it up.  He refused to tell me where he was located.  I called Amazon to try and get my money refunded so that I could just buy him a different watch and they're just being difficult, saying that I'm outside of my 90 day window to complain.  The fact that I started complaining in 5 weeks doesn't count!!  I'm livid.  Don't buy from Dreamshopee, don't buy Skagen, and Amazon might be questionable too.  What a shame.",0

The dials are different, the lettering is off, there's no tuning fork, there's no seriel numbers beneath the 6, also those 'diamonds' look questionable. If this wasn't a 'knock-0ff' watch it would look great for $145 but trying to appear to be the $400 watch off of Bulova's site makes this cheap and cheesy. I just bought a new watch last night and almost bought this one too tonight when I saw the price difference but I'm not getting suckered into buying a fake Bulova, buyers beware.",0

"Purchased 2 of these watches from Amazon, first was listed at $214.99, and the second was $179.99. Both watches turned out to be fakes. The most obvious signs were that the engraving on the bottom of the watch face was printed on, and not actually engraved. The leather strap felt much more plastic like than the band on the genuine watch. ""Citizen 22"" is stamped into the band on both the real and fake watch, but the 22 is stamped in a larger font size on the fake. Finally, the Japan Mov't number located at the bottom of the watch face (right below the 6 hour mark) ended with - CA, not - KA like the actual Japanese movement. Be careful purchasing discounted watches here, good chance the movement is not a real Citizen.",0

"I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon.  The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer.  They were durable and fit well.  They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing (I estimate around 40-50 washes).  So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work.  I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own.  But I wanted the less 'slim' fit of the 505s for work, also wanted the regular and not low rise waist.  So I ordered the same exact size and style:Bad idea!The 505s I got came with a tag saying 'sits below waist', which is NOT what they used to say.  Before, the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s.  Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon, I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair.  Trying the new pair on, I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my 'man parts' being crushed in agonizing ways.  No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans, and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area.  The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s, but the seat was the main difference.  No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505.And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s (in the same color as the new 505s I purchased) I noticed something interesting.  The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s.  It wasn't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing.  The 515s never felt that tough, and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description (no mention of low rise waist) and inferior quality.  I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store.  The previous 505s were also great (Fred Meyer of all places - though they don't have the 505s anymore... booo).  So I'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them.  I'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood.  And the better quality denim means they'll last longer anyway.  So here are my comparisons:Levi's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described, and that the quality appears to vary from order to order.  I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews.  I love Levi's jeans, and I will continue to buy them, but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing.  And remember, if you buy from Amazon, they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items.",1

"I ordered a 3x-4x because I have a large backside and I'm normally a 16-18 nowadays. They seemed to fit fine at first, but after about two hours of wearing them and probably 20 minutes of walking around, the ""control top"" part of the pantyhose proceeded to dig into my crotch. 10 minutes later, after adjusting them several times, they started to pinch and burn so badly I had to leave the store and go home to change immediately. I could barely walk, and every movement hurt. After a day of applying baby powder liberally, I came to realize that the pain in my thighs was actually a second degree burn, complete with blisters and a very painful heat rash that I still have a week later. It still hurts a lot to walk, as I naturally have no thigh gap. I attached a picture from two days after the burn.Don't buy these. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but it is not acceptable if even only 1% of people who use these pantyhose get second degree burns.",1

I was hoping to have it broken it by now but it still feels the same. I am normally a size 5.5-6 so I went with the 6 since the reviews gave a general opinion that it ran on the small side.

"I have purchased reef sandals in black for the past 9 years.  Our local store closed so went to my go to Amazon.  I wear 11's or 12's depending on what the store stocks and both have worked great.  I ordered 12's just to be sure.  When I opened them I had my sons look at them because honestly they look like none of the reefs we have around the house even though the last 9 years look incredibly similar.  We have purchased 27 pairs not counting my wife's.  These are definitely different but was thinking new model year or something.  Tried them on and after a few minutes my feet hurt (not a sign or true reefs), and these 12's are way smaller when held up to my 11's.  To give you an idea, I love the 12's but the sandal hangs out about 1.5 inches from my heel and 3/4 inches from the 11.  On these my heel hangs out.  My conclusion these fit like knock off Nikes fit me, terrible.  Buy with caution because if these aren't fake, they definitely are sized different.  For the record I checked the size on the sandal and they say US 12.  My sons are 31 and 27 so older and I share reefs.  My younger son wears a 10 which were bigger than these.

I had high hopes for this shoe given my wife loves the female version. After 10 minutes though my front toe started to hurt though even though there was plenty of room in the front of the shoe.

When the boots came from Amazon, straight out of the box they looked way too small, but the tag and inside of the tongue both said 7, so I tried them on anyway. Although they were the same size I'd tried on in the store wearing 2 pairs of socks, these were way too tight even with 1 pair of thin socks. I have since returned the boots and gone back to the Dr. Martens store to buy the boots at full price.I would also like to add that the yellow stitching on the sides of the shoes looked very sloppy. I'm not sure if I agree with the other reviews that call these boots fake, but I do believe that they are a different quality than the boots that you get from the official store.

They would have been great if they fit - as they are nice and warm with a nice sole. Just be truthful about size in your product description.",1

"If you're wondering whether or not you want to be a death eater for Halloween, read this breakdown and you can decide for yourself if its for you!First things first, the shipping. It was 2 day shipping for me, and I actually ended up getting it the next day, chalk one up for UPS!Second, the packaging. Now this isn't the most durable costume in the world, but there was plenty of airbags and everythingseemed to be well placed, the ONLY thing I could find wrong with the way it was packaged was that there was a SLIGHT dent in the mask, but since its really thin i kind of expected it to be flattened, which it was not, Way to go guys.Third, the costume itself. You get what is says really, a hooded robe with a separate, (but attachable via included strings) hood. Personally I like that its not sewed on there so I have the option, but that's up to you. The holes in the arms ARE intentional, they're put there so that you can wear the sleeves like a glove (just like the picture shows). The only odd thing I saw was that the collar appeared to face the direction in which wearing it right would leave the opening by the legs on my backside,though I just opened it so maybe i put it on backwards or something. I might just make a cut along the fabric so there's an opening on both sides, it just seems cooler and more comfortable to me. The mask is kind of cheap, but its not going to easily rip as long as you're gentle with it. Obviously you're going to need a wand, but that's sold separately (just in case you didn't read the product description).And to top it off, it even came in a resealable bag with an attached coat hanger, so when you're done with it you can hang it up for next year, or for someone else to use! Have fun and go kill some muggles!EDIT(11/1/11)I must have been handling this costume way too carefully when I took it out of the box. While all of what I said above is still true, the costume was made without any concern to quality. While walking, this thing was constantly ripping, and by the end of the night was no longer usable. Would I still recommend it? Sure, if you have someone willing to sew it for you like I did, but not for the price its asking. Lower it by about 20 bucks, and THEN you're asking a fair price for the amount of work you put into the material and construction (it honestly felt like they used the cheapest quality, thinnest fabric they could find) that you put into this thing. I'm not surprised by this turn of events, but I do feel kind of cheated.",1
"I bought these from the store Whats Hot and they were shipping by amazon. They are absolutely not authentic. Several flaws in the boots. Biggest being the inside. Tags inside aren't stitched as it should be. Shoe tag is so thin is practically see through and its on a flimsy plastic chain. And No Timberlands are made in Vietnam. Anyone who has owned a pair can tell the difference immediately. I will go down to the store and spend the extra $10 to get an authentic pair. The pictures of the black boot are the same size and style from a authorized Timberland dealer. While they are decent looking fakes, there are several flaws in the way they were made. Not nearly as quality as a real pair of timberlands feel. Whatever material this is made with wouldnt last a day. And my timbs last me years. And the puffy tree on the outside should be flush with the boot.",0

My daughters love this toy and want to pull it through the house, but become very frustrated when he falls over.  It seems as if his front paws and back paws are very flexible, allowing him to fall over too easily.  I am very disappointed in this toy.  When I was purchasing it, I read all of the hype about toy awards and thought Spotty would be great.  He's not!!!!",1

"UPDATE!!I was fully prepared to come back and change this review, I kept thinking maybe Nike changed the kind of rubber they used on the soles, but today I got my genuine Converse Chuck Taylor's direct from Nike/Converse's Web site, and the difference is staggering. The shoes ordered from Amazon/Red Pine Hill are 100% fake, no questions asked. The fakes came in a very real looking Converse Box, had all the right markings, but we're made in a different country, and had a different kind of rubber sole (thicker, and softer), and no cloth layer on the bottom of the sole like traditional chucks. They were very high quality fakes, clearly they took a mold of a real chuck and made the shoe from that mold, but probably made by slave labor in a sweat shop, and would have fallen apart a lot faster. FIND AN AUTHORIZED DEALER OF NIKE/CONVERSE! DO NOT BUY THESE FAKES ON AMAZON.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I am confident that the shoes I received from Red Pine Hill were not genuine converse but some imported knock offs being sold for full price. I have owned countless chuck taylors over the years, and never once was I so confused when I first picked up a shoe as when these first arrived. The rubber sole material is not standard converse sole material, but a cheaper grade of rubber. there was no traditional cloth under wrapping on the rubber sole, and the all-star patch on the side was not sewn on as well as the one on my old pair that I was planning to retire. They just didn't feel right. I am sending these back and ordering a pair directly from converse, even if I have to pay a little more for a pair, I don't want some low grade knock-offs.",0

So now, I'm stuck with one shoe that fits and one that doesn't. Not too happy with my purchase. I guess I will have to wear a thick sock on one foot in order for the shoe to fit. Grrr.",1

"First of all, the stitching on the bag is pretty terrible! Within 4-5 days, part of the stitching holding the velcro in place was already becoming undone. By the second week, the stitching around the zippers started getting undone.Next, as everyone mentioned, the buckles are fake and the velcro is placed very poorly and makes you wish the buckles were real.Last, but not least, my first impression after getting the bag. I lifted it and thought the bag was full! IT'S SO HEAVY! Too heavy! But not at all heavy-duty.Keep in mind, with everything I said, my iPad (1.5 lb) was the main thing tossed in there. I don't think the full contents of the bag ever reached over 2.5 lb, yet the bag is already falling apart. Trust me on this, don't buy this bag. It's pretty bad!",0

Devon & Jones emailed me back explaining that the order was cancelled because it was out of stock.  I do not appreciate having to find out that my order was cancelled after it was already late and after I had to inquire about it myself.  There is no excuse for bad customer service.  It left me in a bind to get what I needed for work.  If I do rate it with negative stars I would.  The only saving grace is that Devon & Jones  issued a refund without me having to fight them for that.  Even still, Devon & Jones held on to my money for three weeks, not fair and bad business ethics.",0
"Had a new pair ~7 years ago: very comfortable and durable. These are not of the same quality, and although the length was as expected, the fit is not comfortable, and perhaps a bit narrow. I am not persuaded that a different size (wide rather than medium) would help, and in any case, I was not satisfied with the quality. There are suede flaps (on both edges of the tongue) that ""hang out,"" lying on top of the elastic strips that fasten the edges of the tongue to the body of the shoe. The suede is VERY thin, flimsy and soon wrinkled (would not lie flat over the elastic) and those wrinkly flaps looked terrible.",1

"I just received my TOMS today, which I ordered through Amazon Fulfillment. They seemed very authentic, and, at first, I was very pleased that I didn't get a fake pair like some of the reviews had warned about. Then I looked at one of the papers that came in the box. It was an invoice sheet for someone, who is not me, for an order placed nearly a year ago. I realized that probably meant that these were a stolen pair of TOMS and the person who ordered them originally never got them. So, I called TOMS and talked to a rep about the invoice. She informed me that Amazon.com is NOT an authorized TOMS seller and that a purchase through Amazon.com is not backed by the TOMS One for One movement. I was very sad to hear this as I was excited to be a part of giving a pair of shoes to a child in need. I had to share my discovery in the hopes that people will read this and stop buying TOMS from Amazon, regardless of the lower price. Is a brand name really so important to us that we would forget the most important reason for buying a pair of TOMS? I, for one, will not be keeping this pair, nor will I buy another from Amazon ever again. I would love to wear these TOMS because they are awesome shoes, but I couldn't do that and be proud of the fact that I let a child go without.",0

"While I consider the quality excellent, and the thoughtfulness of the design very good, I can only rank it 3 stars because I'd consider this a small-midsize purse, NOT a day bag. It's actually smaller than the purses most women carry as their everyday purse.I do extensive reading in the travel and guidebook genre, and so I'm pretty confident that my expectations for what a day bag should be are consistent with travel industry standards. To me, a daybag is something you can leave your hotel with in the morning and carry everything you will need for a full day of sightseeing or a long day of flying/traveling by car/bus/train. A standard day-bag packing list includes all of the small personal items usually packed in a purse (phone, hand sanitizer, wallet, keys, gum, personal items, etc) as well as: a light-weight sweater, water, snack/small lunch, itinerary, guidebook/map, camera, and an umbrella or tiny packable rain jacket. My necessities also include a novel if I'll be flying/commuting and a journal. I have always been able to easily carry all of this (and more!!) in a small backpack (10-15 liter), large ""hobo bag"" style purse, messenger bag, or very small tote bag, with room to spare in case you pick up a souvenir or take off your hat or something. That is what comes to my mind when I think of a day bag, and what my expectations (based on the name of the product and the picture displaying the bag on the model) were for the Piazza Day Bag to have this sort of capacity. In this regard, it falls far short.To my pleasant surprise, all of the small items, including a 16 oz travel mug and an umbrella did fit- I was doubtful upon first opening the package. However, Although there are ample pockets, they do not expand outwards, but rather inwards, which greatly decreases the space in the main compartment.  With some difficulty, I could only fit either the journal, book or a very tightly rolled/folded very light sweater (not all 3 or even 2 of these items.) into the main compartment. They wouldn't fit at all into the outer pockets.  If you did place a larger item in the bag, it became impossible to reach the interior pockets without pulling items out of the purse, which is not only inconvenient, it could be unsafe, as you are more likely to lose something and also you will be making yourself a target for any lurking pick pockets and purse snatchers.I do love that all but 1 exterior pocket zips shut, and that the only open pocket is under the front flap.The flannel lined sunglasses pocket out front is a great idea, however, when the purse was packed and the sunglasses pocket was zipped shut, my sunglasses were getting smushed. Likewise, the 2 granola bars got broken and smashed in all of the pockets I tried them in, as the rest of the contents of the bag were pushing on them. This was true even when I didn't have a large item in the bag.I also love the concept of the key fob, but hated the location. It is located in the sunglasses pouch on the front of the bag. I understand they were probably trying to choose an accessible location, but the problem is 1) keys will scratch sunglasses and 2) this is the among the most vulnerable places on the whole bag for pick pocketers.A lot of people complained that the water bottle pouch wasn't big enough. I was able to easily fit my 16 oz insulatedContigo travel mug (no handles) in it, however, unless the bag was packed full and the weight was balanced just so, when carrying the bag it would tip and the mug would fall out. I'm not sure if there would be the same problem with a ""disposable"" plastic water bottle.  I was able to just barely fit my tiny umbrella in the other side pouch. The umbrella was too tall to zip the poich shut completely, but seemed pretty secure anyway.Another thing a lot of reviewers commented on was that the purse was very lightweight. While I agree that it is much more light weight than say a leather handbag, for its size I would actually consider it to be mid weight. The purse holds its structure pretty well- it's not like a lightweight canvas or nylon bag that can be smushed down flat or rolled into a suitcase or backpack. If you plan to pack the purse, allow as much room as the bag dimensions, even if it's empty.As for the quality, it seems to be very well made. I got the Slate grey color and really like it. It was true to the picture in Amazon. The fabric has a slight sheen. The bag seems to be stitched together very well, and I noticed no flaws. The zippers seem very durable and unlikely to catch. The fabric and the strap do seem a bit ""sporty,"" but I would not be embarrassed to carry this bag anywhere casual clothes are acceptable. I disagree with the reviewers who say it looks ""cheep."" I actually prefer my travel bags not to look too expensive- it's less tempting to thieves that way.The only thing questionable about the quality, in my opinion, is that the bottom of the bag is very thin. It appears to be 2 layers of the nylon fabric. I held it up to the light with my hand behind it and could clearly see my hand through the bottom of the purse. It seems to be stitched together well, and nylon is pretty tough, but I could imagine the bottom wearing out over time, and also exceptionally vulnerable to purse slashers.As for comfort, i haven't used it all day, so I can't be a very good judge, but from my experimentation around the house, it seemed fine. It's such a small bag it would be hard to pack enough to make it too heavy. The strap adjusted nicely and fit around my body very well as a cross body bag or on my shoulder. The strap is flat and slick and reminds me of a seatbelt. I tried it on with a fleece jacket, t-shirt, and my suede winter coat. The strap did slip a bit on all 3 fabrics when worn over the shoulder, but was fine as a cross-body bag. I do question if the edges of the strap would cause friction on your skin if you carried it for a length of time while wearing a tshirt or tank top and had the purse packed fairly heavily. But like I said, I haven't used it enough to make that judgement.I bought this product spontaneously, based on the product description and images, as it was a lightening deal and the time was almost up. I wish I'd researched it more throughly. I take most of the responsibility for not being thorough enough before purchasing, but to be fair, the images and description led me to believe this had equivalent capacity to what most daybags have. If it was advertised as a purse and if I was in need of a casual purse, I'd be exceedingly happy with this product. However, it does not fit my needs for a day bag, so I will be returning it.In summary: 5 stars as a small purse. 1 star as a day bag.Photos: 1) day bag items. 2) Those same items packed into the Piazza Day Bag, and what did not fit. View inside purse when fully packed. As you can see, interior pockets are nearly impossible to access. 4) View inside purse when guide book was removed. Fully packed bag. As you can see, umbrella and water bottle do not perfectly fit in designated pouches. Water bottle fell out as I was walking with the purse as a cross body bag.",1

"As another reviewer stated, the scale that is being sent is not the one pictured. The manufacturer has changed the product, but failed to change the packaging and product description. Even their website still shows the older version of the scale with the yellow knob. The actual product that you will receive is made in China. It has cheaper plastic components. The twistable knob that saves the measurement is so loose that just touching the scale makes it move, which makes it almost impossible to get an accurate reading.I contacted the manufacturer and they basically said this is the scale they are now selling. They are aware that the packaging and the actual product are different. They told me to send it back to Amazon if I am unhappy. I was, and I did.I also want to mention that Amazon has been wonderful and worked with me to meet my satisfaction. This is not Amazon's fault. As a result of the complaints, Amazon has suspended sale of this item and is investigating the issue.UPDATE: The correct image and product info now showing on Amazon. The new version of the scale still has cheaper components and quality issues. I would pass on this one.",1

How is a 3 year old expected to use a backpack that can't be secured because of fake magnets that don't hold?

"First, I have to say that these shoes look great, fit great and have a very good arch support.  I really like the shoes but and did not want to return them, but i did.  The issue was with squeaking.  Every step; it's embarrasing.  For $80 I expect better than that.  I saw the posts where the manufacturer recommended adding talcum powder or baby oil to the soles.  Once again, for $80, you shouldnt have to be trying to fix a design flaw.  Guess I'll have to look to another brand unless Merrell can offer me a pair that do not squeak.One last comment: Over the last few years I've noticed a decline in quality of the shoes from companies known in the past for offering high quality; however, the prices are still quite high, in my opinion.  But I suppose that if we consumers continue to buy the merchandise without complaint, the quality will continue to slide and we will be paying a bundle for a brand name that doesn't live up to its reputation.",1
"I have never worn a Nike shoe where the tag was somewhere other than the underside of the tongue. My first thought when pulling them out was they had to be fake... Giving them the benefit of the doubt I tried them on. The right shoe isn't even ""foot shaped"". The heel-cup sits so that my toes are pushed toward the outside of the shoe - it's like I put my straight foot into an S-shaped shoe.I read somewhere that Amazon lumps reviews of the same product from different companies into one thread. I double and triple checked that I ordered from ""Nike"" but this was shipped by ""AllYouNeedLLC"".If these are truly real Nike's (which I highly doubt) then it's an awful shoe. Dissapointing too because I really need something I can tighten around my arch.Easy return. Took pics and reported to ""counterfeit@Nike.com""",0
"Hate is a harsh word to use for a review, but one star is an appropriate rating in this case. I wear a size 7, and although these shoes fit my feet, the arch area was far too tight. I tried wearing them for a day but my feet immediately hurt and after a few hours wear I had a large blister on one heel and the veins in the top of my feet were enlarged. It took a few hours for my feet to return to normal, but I still have some scarring from the blister the shoes gave me (a few weeks after the initial wear). I didn't want to try to stretch the arch area because that may have ruined the shoes. Perhaps the ones I received were more for a narrow ""A"" foot, rather than a medium narrow width, but I have never had an issue like that nor do I ever wish to repeat the experience. It was definitely not what I was expecting, nor was it what I read in the product description.",1

"I did a lot of research about comfortable office/dress shoes online, and these shoes were on many of the top 10 lists.  The good reviews and the Amazon rating was enough for me to buy a pair, but my actually experience was awful.The good: The soles of the shoe were very comfortable and provide a lot of mid-foot support. The soles felt like a running shoe.The bad: The leather uppers are the worst.  They look and feel like pressure injected plastic.  The strange marble texture looks fake and artificially created to poorly mimic real leather.  They look rather cheap, and I would never wear these shoes in a formal setting.The shoes are completely rigid. They don't have the supple leather feel of a nice pair of comfortable shoes. It's hard and stiff. For $129.95 per pair, they could have at least used decent leather for the uppers. Some of the reviews on Amazon said the shoes need to be broken in. Well, I tried wearing it for 5 weeks daily, and it was still rigid. I had to stop wearing them when the back of the right shoe started rubbing the heel of my foot causing a bad hot spot. The pain in my heel and Achilles tendon caused me to limp. I wasn't going to maim myself to break in a pair of shoes. BTW, I'm a hiker and a runner so I don't have delicate feet.It's really a shame because the soles are great. If I could just replace the uppers with a nice supple leather, it would be an amazing shoe.",0

"This is really inexpensive plastic.  Soda bottles are sturdier plastic than this.  But no one else seems to make anything of quality to reflect this medal.

But if you are just looking for something to cheap to wear as a costume item, it will serve the purpose.  It probably won't last the night though.",1

I would like to know where these Jeans were sold from. They are notb100% cotton and wrinkle terribly in the dryer. The material is rough and cheap feeling. I think they are fake Levi's and am returning them. The tag says made in Malaysia and the other Levi's I have are made in China. Not sure how to tell if they are real or fake but will look in to it and report if need be. Maybe that's why they are so cheap? They say on the tag part polyester so the above description is not true. Horrible material.,0
"I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes. However, these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase. The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material, I was shocked and in disbelief. Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time. Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly? Now I have the joy of sending them back. I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions, not sure why the hesitation. I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear.",1
" The colors are wrong, the helmet is narrow, you can barely see out of it, not symmetrical at all, nothing lines up, and the range finder falls in front of your nose.

"I have both this product and the high-waisted mid-thigh shaper, and the high-waisted shaper is a significantly better product. Perhaps it may be due to my long torso, but the power panty is honestly too short in the waist.

I got these shoes about a year ago. They still aren't as comfy as my other Birks. I feel like the cut is off or the leather is different.

Either the quality Birkenstock has degraded or I got fakes.,0

Those 2nd color ``Vegas-Gold``was darker than before, slightly light brass, but not unattractive, so i don't maded a cancellation. 3rd Vegas-Gold color i got by receiving ,and is ugly. It's a mix between creme and citrus , a metal-like color or -effect you search vainly! I had been glad for getting a description-like color , but this what i got is hard to wear as sweat, i use it as winter-undershirt.Purchased colors ash and scarlet too, there are like description pictures. But, when you can elect: Choose 1780style, the 1049 has not deserved the term ``style`` cause the body is made like for a human, sleeves are made like for another human, lenghths and openings are made like fits to an 3rd human, not matching at all, no style, no look.

I got light toast and they are a great color for my light skin tone.  They are much better quality and will last much longer!  I ordered a size D in the Danskin tights and they are perfect.

First of all, if you look closely at the watch itself and/or read the product description, you will notice that this watch claims to be water resistant to 100 meters, which by my math is roughly 300 feet.

I found that if I continued to shake it, it would run but as soon as I stopped it stopped after about 30 minutes.  The jewelry repair rep had me bring it back to see if the connections were meeting and they were.  The screw to wound the watch is so tiny I could barely grasp it.  Imagine trying to keep it set...smh!  The clasp is difficult to latch but that wouldn't be a problem if there weren't so many other problems.

"My one remaining boob does not stay in the bra.  It slips out below!  I have never had this happen before, and though the band is comfortable, I don't think it is too big.  Maybe it is just me.  It feels very comfortable until I look in the mirror and see a bulge below the bra!  The straps do not adjust, and I am not sure what to do.  I am 65, and I had a mastectomy when I was 42.  I am 5'2"", 125 pounds.  I am mostly comfortable in 36 bras with a C cup.  I think because by now gravity has overtaken me, and the radiation I received so many years ago has made me a rather odd shape.  I am 10 - 15 pounds heavier than when I had my mastectomy.  So when I say this might just be my experience, these are the reasons why.",1

Not happy that these can only be returned in unworn condition.  The fit seemed fine but by the end of the day I had to pull them up so many times that I wondered if I should been ordering a size for someone much taller. So there doesn't seem to be any uniformity in Hanes' hosiery sizing because I used their size charts for every pair of hosiery I've ordered over the past few months and the fit varies so much that I'm reluctant to even try anymore.,1

As I was folding them up to ship them back, I noticed something was very off. First, the numbers are missing. Every single pair of Levi's is numbered to their style and plastered everywhere. The back perma tag is so different it's a wonder everyone doesn't notice this and feel scammed. Even the trademark but tag is missing the logo. Almost every single logo on these pants is missing the actual word Levi's I plan on posting pics of all the tags so you can see how fake these are.Had these jeans been $15 and not marked as Levi's, I would probably keep them, but paying $40 for name brand/high quality jeans only to have Amazon screw you over and send knock offs is a joke. Now I have to check my new shoes over to make sure they aren't knock offs! Amazon has become such a crap shoot lately. I RARELY order from people on the marketplace so the fact that these are sold and Shipped directly from Amazon is just so messed up!",0

"Since Bali discontinued the bra that was my favorite (one that had truly non-slip straps), I thought I'd once again try this old standby which has been available for decades. It's a good product, but it is far from perfect.The underwires have no cushioning and feel harsh against the skin, and the straps slip off my shoulders constantly, which is the reason I stopped wearing this style before.The ad copy claims that the straps and back have been redesigned into a ""Comfort-U"" shape to eliminate slipping, so I thought I'd give this bra a try again. Unfortunately, it really doesn't work. In two days of wearing my brand-new purchases, I find that the straps constantly fall onto my arms and that I must replace them back onto my shoulders every few minutes. This affects the ability of the bra to provide support, and is a major annoyance, especially when I'm active, or when I'm in a business meeting where I really, really do not want to be fiddling with my clothing.I won't be buying more of this style.",1

"These were not worth the price.  They are very hard and not flexable.  They are very skimpy.  If you buy, make sure you get the next larger size than they say you need.

"The concept of this costume is great, but the designer really cut corners in the design and materials that were used. The material is thin and more shear than is decent. The back of the dress is a solid color instead of keeping it consistent with the front of the dress. Though I understand why they put in the high neck (so you wouldn't have to do the neck make-up), it makes the look of the dress seem off. The gloves were fine. The wig was terrible!! There was barely enough yarn on it to cover the head bag it was attached to. I would have had to go out and buy more yarn and sew it on myself to get a proper look. When I buy costumes all I want to do is add accessories- not buy more materials to improve the product I paid for. I would recommend making your own Sally costume if you want something decent. The Standard and the Sassy Sally are worth the money.",1
"I ordered a Spanx product and 2 bra's. I specified in my email that I absolutely needed it on 4/10/09. They sent an email that it had been dropped off to UPS on 4/9.09. As of 4/13/09 I do not have the package. The wedding is over. I tried sending emails - no replies. I talked to a very unfriendly woman this afternoon. Even AMEX understood that NOT delivering a wedding item in time for a wedding is inappropriate and they have placed a STOP on the charge.  Of course once I advised Bare Necessities that I had stopped payment with AMEX, they answered my emails.  I've read several reviews about Bare Necessities on line since ordering and it seems common practice to promise something by X date and to not come through!  I had asked for my $22 overnight fee to be refunded - had they answered that email, I would have been fine but they choose to ignore my emails and when I didn't have the package 2 business days later, after paying for 1 business day delivery, I called AMEX to dispute the charge.  They'll never ger my business again.  I hope to post this on every site that accepts reviews for Bare Necessities - they are horrible - no customer service to speak of.  Unfortunate for them given the recession a little bit would have went a long way.Well, their loss.  And a lesson learned - check reviews BEFORE purchasing.  (Oh, their checkout process - you don't even get a chance to cancel the order - I hit forward and bang, the order was processed - no chance to change your order or mind.).  I also plan on writing a stern letter to them.  This is an example of what customer service has come to with some companies - they plain just don't care.I refuse their products based on their lousy customer service.",0

It fits and that's about the only good thing I can say about it.  There is velcro tabs in some places but there is no corresponding velcro to close the suit or to attach the cape.  I had to spend an hour sewing velcro on to this costume so that it can actually be worn.  If you don't know how to sew then it is unusable.  If I hadn't opened the package early to have my 3 year old try it on then we wouldn't have a costume for Halloween.,1

"Don't get me wrong! I LOVE Gold Toe brand socks and they're the only socks that EVER touch my feet, but...DON'T BE MISLED BY THE WORD ""FLUFFIES!""When I bought these, I was under the impression that they were going to be normal ""everday casual"" socks, and with the word ""fluffies"" in the title, I was assuming they'd be thick. You know, what most shoppers think when they believe that they can trust the product description from a respectable company, but I was wrong. I guess I should have been more careful when reading the materials and saw that they didn't include cotton, but again, ""fluffies"" was there so...Needless to say, these sock are NOT fluffy nor are they casual. They're thin, fall down constantly unless you wear sock suspenders dress socks. They feel more like the hosiery socks that you get when renting a tux, but at least those stay up. VERY DISAPPOINTED!",1

"Very disappointed in the product. It is not what is pictured in the product description. The flag is not painted on metal - is some sort of adhesive picture taped over metal piece, and the waving shape of the label doesn't match the shape of the metal. Very disappointed.

Back side has no pattern! It fits well and I like the length of the dress but I feel like I was tricked because it doesn't say that the back side of the dress is a solid pink color anywhere in the product description. Very disappointed because I don't have time to send it back.,1
This for sure needs to be shown at different angles. Sound was very muffled and fake as was the scream.,0

"Bought a pair of these after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon. What a waste of $30! First of all, these things are no more than glorified control top nylons. Secondly, was a little unsure about the size, so did my best guess. I'm assuming I need a size smaller, but won't waste anymore money. They were tight and uncomfortable. They did tuck my tummy in SLIGHTLY, but because they are an extra layer of fabric, made my favorite jeans TIGHTER. Don't listen to these reviews. Wearing these for more than 2 hours is torture, and mine were even a little BIG. Can't imagine squeezing into anything smaller........",1
"These tights are the kind that support circulation for elderly or less mobile women, or possibly even post-surgical situations. I thought they were ""control top"", but they are ""full support""extremely firm all over.

"Either the pair of Converse I received from this seller were counterfeit knock-offs or Converse has farmed out their manufacturing to the cheapest country with the poorest of quality standards. I bought this pair of Monochrome Blck All-Star Hi-Tops because it is my favorite style and my current pair was getting worn. When the new pair arrived I took them out of the box and placed them in my closet to be ready when the older pair was completely done. Well, the new pair had sat in my closet for about three weeks until today when I finally needed to wear them and to my dismay I discovered that they were the worst pair of Comverse I had ever seen. I wish I had inspected them better prior to trusting this seller and having thrown away the box so that I could return them. When I attempted to lace up and wear these shoes they felt oddly uncomfortable on my feet as if they were not the correct size and then I noticed the laces were at least 6 inches shorter than the standard All-Star Hi-Top laces. As I neared the top eyelets of the shoes one of the metal rings that surround the eyelets completely fell apart and off of the shoe. That when I took the shoes off and began inspecting them thoroughly. It is than that I noticed excessive glue at every seam as if the shoes were sloppily put together, the rubber emblem patch on the side of the shoe was incorrect and poorly seen on. I started comparing the new shoes to my older pair and not even the insole was correct, it was a completely different color, the new insole was black and the old was white. The actual bottom sole of the shoes were completely different as well with the original and authentic pair displaying the shoe size and the counterfeit pair not. I compared the model numbers of the shoes and they were the only thing that matched but the labels that they were printed on were completely different as well, not only were they different but they were both manufactured in completely different countries. The labels on the heel of the shoes were also completely different. This is the second time I have made a purchase on Amazon and have been shipped a counterfeit item, the last time it was a Carhartt hat that I ordered. I will no longer be shopping on Amazon as they do not monitor the products that these independent sellers are ripping us off with. I was ripped-off and will only be ordering my converse from Converse's website directly from here on out.",1

"These are FAKE do not buy! When i tried them on i noticed the felt a much different than the ones i had tried on in a store. Upon careful inspection i noticed a few things were off. First to my knowledge ray ban does not make folding wafarers in a matte black finish with g-15 lenses, so this was my first indication that it was fake. Second i noticed that the small rb engraving on the lens was raised, which means that it was not laser engraved(all authentic ray ban products with an rb etching are laser engraved). Also there were a couple items missing in the packaging that authentic ray bans should come with. Do not buy from this seller unless u want expensive fakes.",0

This bra does not have enough support especially with the narrow straps and very hard to adjust the straps. The longline Bali bra was the best. I wore the Bali bra over 20 years. The only thing I disliked about the Bali bra was that the metal stey would sometimes break. I noticed tthat in the past few years that  the elastic straps seemed not as strong.,1
I bought this in good faith and was totally shocked at its quality and overall usability. It's not enough for what they said in the product description and it was WAY smaller as well. Don't buy. I returned it quickly.,1

"Don't let Invicta's glowing and smooth advertisements fool you - there is nothing original about their watch designs, and nothing quality about their products. This model is a blatant rip off (and terribly) of the Rolex Submariner, an ACTUALLY timeless and high quality watch. This....is only fit for back alley hacks or the trashcan at WalMart. If you do some research you'll find that Invicta is the antithesis of originality and quality; they are seemingly always on extreme sale...making you wonder about falsely advertised prices artificially inflated so they can be excitingly (and perpetually) on sale for huge margins. If you want original watch designs...look elsewhere. If you want quality time pieces....look elsewhere. If you're broke and enjoy pretending you're not a peasant and are ok with perpetuating the replica/fake/knock-off industry....Invicta is there for you.",0

"Normally if you do not have a real one to compare ,you can say that is real because all the bells are at the right place. Just happen that I bought one from the named department store (paid big bucks) and I find this to be really a bargain so I give it a try. when the item come ,first I notice the feel is already difference when I hold them both in my same hand. To do a further comparison,I noticed one of its leg is shorter and also the metal insert inside both legs by the joints are smaller compare to the real one. Too good to be true, it is ok that you want a real good fake or if you want the real one forget it. The picture showing is the real one ,the fake one going back to amazon.",0

However, Seiko confirmed to me that it's only ""water-resistant"" for water splashes such as when washing hands only, otherwise, it'll fill up with water.  I got this info directly from Seiko!  Amazon should correctly advertise product, because if you use it to swim/shower in, the watch will break and you'll be out your money!  Come on, Amazon, correct your product descriptions!",1

I don't think i can return the products anyways and i bought these 2 gift my relatives.Its surprising to see how Amazon allows these sellers to advertise them as genuine Dopp products and then sell fakes.I was really upset, the mahogany and black are made of totally different types of leather. And the black one from Tapp Collection feels cheap.However, the brown(mahogany) ones from Direct Premium came in a nice Dopp box and the quality of the leather is also different and not cheap like the black one from Tapp Collections.So buyers better be careful when buying this product off Tapp Collection",0

"Jean-Pierre and I LOVE to have our monthly Redneck Night.  We put on our tight jeans, our silver-tipped cowboy boots, and our big David Allan Coe hats.  We stock up on Marlboro's, Red Man, lite pork rinds and Zima (longnecks, of course).  We even get Duchess and Fifi into the act with spiked pitbull collars.  We strut our stuff into the Bubba Room and watch our favorite redneck movies:  usually Roadhouse or Brokeback Mountain.  When Jean-Pierre came along, I had to mothball the Jean-Claude Van Damme movies because French people look at Belgium the same way Americans look at Canada.Anyway, we felt like something was missing from our Redneck Night, but we couldn't put our finger on it until we saw this t-shirt.  OMG!!!!!!!!  We even bought extras, framed them and hung them in the Bubba Room.  We had the secret ingredient!Or so I thought. . .I was horribly wrong.  Those wolves have WHITE teeth!  How fake can you get?  Trust me, we have brought Duchess and Fifi to every vet and dentist in Midtown, but you can't get a dog's teeth whitened, let alone a wolf's.  Jean-Pierre and I were crushed.  Sorry, one star for these shirts!UPDATE:  After all my bitching, one of my ladies at the salon brought me some glow-in-the dark nail polish to put on the wolves' teeth.[...]It was a miracle - suddenly, they looked completely wild and authentic.  Jean-Pierre and I were so excited that we spent a solid month in the Bubba Room.  Duchess and Fifi were so hungry when we came out that they nearly ate us.  Five hundred stars!",0
"I should have listened to the first reviewer who said the costume didn't fit her husband who is 5'6 - she said it wouldn't close in back.

"I bought these boots after admiring my friends. When they came in the mail, they looked off to me. I compared them side by side with my friend's boots and am convinced mine were fake. My friend bought hers from Nordstroms. My Amazon boots were different because the leather looked overly worn and crinkled, the inside sole of the boot was a completely different color, and the inside label about man made leather was worded differently. I also went to Nordstroms and tried on the same pair of boots to see how mine compared. The boots in the store were identical to my friends. I chose to return my boots to Amazon because I feel they are not as good as quality as I found in the department store and I went ahead and bought these boots at Nordstrom. So disappointing!",0

The quality of the 'distressed nylon' on these bags is just not what it used to be.  I bought one for my hubby about 10 years ago and it wore beautifully.  It got softer and more pliable and looked better and better over the years and he carried it daily.  Now they feel like a cheap nylon bag and the 'distressed' quality is barely noticeable.  They're stiff and cheap looking when new and that doesn't get any better with use.  Really disappointed in Ameribag.  Seems like they've taken the path of so many other companies....cutting corners here and there to pump up the bottom line convinced the consumer won't notice. We. Do. Notice.  Doubt I buy another.  Sling bags are everywhere now so there are other options.,1

Pants were rather tight thru my hips and thighs.

Tried to blow it up to wear it for halloween and it had a hole in the seam. He wasn't even rough on the jet pack.  Waste of Money!!!!!,1
Not much more to say ... I'd give them zero starts if I could. They ripped immediately when trying to put them on for the first time. Had to make an emergency Walmart trip for cheap hose that did NOT rip!,1

"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SUNGLASSES SOLD BY SUNGLASS EXPRESS. THEY ARE FAKE.The glasses sold by Sunglass Express are absolutely, 100% fake. I recently purchased them (now regretting it immensely) despite the fact that I was unsure if it was really a wise choice on my part. Let me just tell you, they're incredibly well-made counterfeits. I went to Nordstrom, where they told me they were not completely sure, but that they seemed legit. After that, I wore them happily until I found my old Ray Bans that I thought I had lost. I compared the two and...well...I knew immediately. **The old Ray Bans were purchased from a licensed retailer found on the Ray Ban website** The cleaning cloth has a strange plastic smell that the original does not, and the printed Ray Ban logo has a strange plastic feel that the real Ray Ban also does not have. The material of the cleaning cloth is different, as is the texture. The case that it came with is also just a little bit different, to the point where it's barely perceptible if you're not paying close attention. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed as this product was fulfilled by Amazon, and I was expecting a real pair of sunglasses.ALSO, I forgot to mention. To the original sellers of this product: I HAVE REPORTED THIS SELLER TO THE IPR, AS WELL AS NOTIFIED RAY BAN AND VARIOUS OTHER COUNTERFEIT PREVENTING ASSOCIATIONS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",0
"The size guide clearly shows that you are ordering in men's sizes.  I ordered a size 7B(M).  That is a size & in MEN'S.  That is a size 9 in women's .  What I received was a size 5 men's which is a size 7 in women's.  I find that to be the biggest pain in the butt.  It is hard enough to order Converse.  Amazon vendors don't make it any easier.  Some vendor sizes say men's sizes but the verbiage says stuff like, ""These are really women's sizes- so order them in your regular size- but make sure they are 1/2 size smaller than usual!""  errrrgg..  Converse are worth the 1/2 size calculation and even the men's vs. the women's nonsense- but when the vendor simply puts the wrong sex on the sizing chart- THAT is unacceptable.  Now, I have a shoe that is two sizes too small.  And I have to return them.  Thank GOD I ordered them via PRIME membership or I would be paying $17 shipping.  Wouldn't that be a real winner?

However, there is a problem with all of the metal wire aviator style frames.  They will easily lose their shape and that will cause the lenses to fall out.  Trying to get some help on how to fix this from Ray-Ban's customer service department is impossible.  They simply won't give out any information, unless you first send in your glasses via insured and certified postal delivery.  The closest I came to getting any helpful information after re-phrasing my question was the costs of repair could range from $60 to $80 for the frames and $40 for the lenses.  I won't buy any more Ray-Bans.  They're already quite expensive.",0

There is no access to the diaper area (no snaps, etc. in the panties part of the costume) and there is only one small entry point in the back of the dress, which closes with cheap velcro. So you have to pull the dress through your child's legs and up over the whole body every time you take it on or off. Plus, it runs small. And the elastic around the panties of the dress is super tight. The Minnie Mouse emblem is poorly attached and could easily be torn off. Don't waste your money. We are returning it.",1

Now I am several months out of the warrantee period and they are useless and heading for the trash.  I just received a pair of size 11 Keen Brixens.  They fit comfortably, seem true to size, and appear to be far more waterproof than the Merrell's.

I have a pair of these exact sunglasses in a Polarized Lens and I wanted a second pair to give to my brother, however, I am so disappointed as I received a pair that was MADE IN CHINA stamped and don't get me wrong, I don't hate on the imported goods since almost everything would be impossible to be cost-efficient to the customer if it weren't made in China or at least some part of it.. but having the two exactly identical pairs of sunglasses next to each other and actually being able to physically see the differences and more importantly, see the different build quality- WOW. It makes more than a world of difference!The hinges pop more amply on the Made in Italy (MII) whilst the Made in China (MIC) one leaves much to be desired like a one-night stand. The metal on the MII is also visibly and incredibly physically heavier, durable and much better to the feel of my hand than the MIC one. The MIC one feels cheap and while I can't determine 100% if it's metal or not, it almost feels like plastic that's been coated over with metal spray.. the wording and stamps on it are also much messier than the MII one that I have laying right next to it.There are so many more details I could go into about the differences and the horrible build quality of the MIC but beware of what you are paying for. The price is the same that I paid for my Ray-Ban's on Amazon a while back but you are getting much MUCH less bang for your buck with the Made in China frames (even if they ARE authentic.. to me they are utterly fake because their quality is unmatched with the Made in Italy frames).So? Buy from Amazon- not any of these pop-up Seller's. I made that mistake, don't be like me. Don't be a unlucky Brian.Avoid the seller: Sunglass Express at all costs!",0

The one star is for the incompetence of the delivery.  I understand that external factors happen however the product was ordered on December 9th and finally made it to my town a week ago.  Today is Christmas and all the gifts are given but I did not have anything to give.  UPS updates everyday with a new delivery date then does not deliver.  I hope that this is a wake up call on reformulating online ordering.,0

These tights came in ""DKNY"" packaging but the tights themselves do not have a label in them, the material is different than my Nordstrom-purchased DKNY tights, and the crotch area is sewn differently as well. I'm not asking for a refund because I discarded the packaging that these came in, but buyer beware--these are most likely fakes.",0

Bought 2 pairs and both ripped before getting them on fully. They're the correct size and I did not pull or tug on them excessively.  Extremely unsatisfied.,1
Ad was deceptive. Several references to sherpa(known for their wool)but no apparent connection to the product. The sherpa lining referred to in the product description turned out to be polyester. I would not have purchased the product if there had been a clear explanation about the polyester lining.,1
"These ripped as soon as I put them on. Poor quality, do not buy.",1
"What a disappointment. I have a pair of Cole Haan Trilby loafers that I think I bought at Nordstrom. I loved them so much I bought a second pair. The ones I bought from Amazon are nothing like the originals. They're cheaper leather and after only 5 wearings, they're starting to pull apart at the stitching. They're much wider than the others and are starting to gap. I just read a review that said that these are fakes and I would believe it. These are made in India.",0
Should have ordered larger than the listed size. These shorts and pants always run small...,1
Terrible... these are extremely thick and large.  Wish I didn't open them so I could return.  Complete waste of money,1
"My son is 11-years-old and wears a 12-slim pants. The description claims they are for 11-14 but the packaging says 12-14. At any rate, this costume is so tight on him it's embarrassing even without using the spongey chest and abs insert. And he's a skinny kid. Also, the mask is made out of some type of spongey material. I think an elastic cloth would've been a better choice. He can't even wear the mask because he can't breath with it on and it smooshes his nose. If your child is maybe 9- or 10-years-old, this might be a good choice, however.",1
"Bought the same size my daughter wears in her old converse, but these were huge...guess they were men's size not woman's?",1
"not working,,,, put on a new battery and still not working, apparently its fake, they just used the name skagen, what a waste,,,",0
Even though the advertisement indicated these converse shoes were designed for women...they Are NOT!!! I spent a lot of time searching for the right pair and fit. Very Disappointed,1
"I used to buy this brand all the time, so I was happy to see them available here. The quality was the worst I've ever seen for any nylons. It was like buying second hand. These were in worse shape then my 10 year old pair. Gross and tore the first time putting them on.",1
I am a female with an enormous foot and so I usually buy men's 11 instead of women's 13s.  This shoe actually came in a 14 for women so I bought it but it was huge.  It seems the colored ones run larger so I ended up a men's black size which fits perfectly.,1
To big to long to stiff,1
I own the original pair of these in a different color. These boots are FAKE ! Or - uggs has a new manufacturer who now makes crappier boots. My husband and I compared the pair I own already and these that arrived from amazon. From the outside and the sole they are the same. But the inside is completely different these are polyester or plastic lined and my old ones are soft and I believe made of wool. The tag on my original pair looks very luxurious and expensive with embroider letters and these new ones had just a small cheap shire tag with black printed text. Overall they looked like a cheap replica. I have to go to uggs store and see if they just make them like this now or these are fake but I am returning these.,0
"Maybe worth 10.00 but certainly not 40.00, material of entire costume is extremely low quality.  Not worth the price",1
"This watch seemed perfect for a 13 year old who worries about getting everywhere on time. He liked the idea of ""Ironman"" yet it is still small enough not to swallow his 13-year-old wrist. Plus it had all the features he wanted and more, especially a light function. However, the first one lasted less than a year. I replaced the battery, but that wasn't the problem. So I bought a second one and this one lasted less than 3 months before the light quit working. The return date is past, so I am sending it back at my expense and taking whatever refund is offered.",1
Sizing is WAY off(too small) ,1
I spent extra to have it shipped overnight for our cruise to the Bahamas...ugggh...waste of money! The hat is ridiculous and my husband actually laughed when I put it on!!

I live in the North Woods and must now suffer cold feet all winter.I guess the product description didn't say they weren't thin, so I can't really complain.  But, that's why I am here.  You're welcome.  I'm here to tell you, they're really thin.  Do you hear me?",1

The product description is very misleading...while at the top of the page it says the heel is 3 1/4"" the description of the product says aprox. 4"", while in reality the boot is barely 3"", the leather is very (VERY) thin and brittle feeling and scratches very easily as apparent from the condition they arrived in with 3 scratches in the leather...the leather is also very matte and while the calf is a small circumference which i needed they bag at the ankles and over the top of my foot looking mis-sewn...overall the boot looks very cheap for the money and I'm disappointed and frustrated to no end. I have no idea where to find a good leather, black, 4"" heeled, over the knee boot with a small calf circumference of 13-14 inches only! I've been looking for months now and it's been one hassle after another.  so unfortunately, these boots will also be returned. :(",1

VERY HORRIBLE QUALITY. DO NOT RECOMMEND. JUST PAY A LITTLE MORE AND BUY A GOOD ONES.MINE CAME WITH A VERY WEIRD RAY-BAND LOGO AND THE SUNGLASSES FELT VERY BIG COMPARE TO THE NORMAL ONESELF.

THE FIRST ONES (NEW WAYFARER) WERE PERFECT SO I DECIDED TO BUY MORE... TOTALLY REGRET IT.Update: i tried to get them fixed. They are totally fake. Do not buy!,0

So I think it is reasonable to say the the most important part to this costume is the white collar and this one is terrible. All stretched out and too long and also too thin. I would not recommend this costume.,1
These shoes run smaller than than all my previous jungle mochs. Going to send them back,1
"To start the company sent me the wrong costume, I had to return it and wait for the right one, again the second time they sent me a similar one but not the one I asked for.  They sent me a costume that has a pump that gives (fake) blood to the chest, instead the one I asked gave blood to the head.  It was too late to return it again.After that my son wore it and the pump pierced so there was red food coloring everywhere, in his clothes, hands.I do not recommend to buy costumes from that store.  Sorry.",0
"I feel like I'm wearing Khaki colored track pants with these. The material isn't 100% cotton as stated in the product description, the pants feel plasticy and make a lot of noise when walking due to whatever material these pants are made out of and treated with to be ""iron free"". They're are also relatively baggy in the thighs and not very slim fitting. I decided to give these pants a chance due to the appeal of being iron free and I have worn them twice. However, I don't plan on wearing them again and I will be donating these pants in the near future.  If you are looking to purchase Docker's I would stick with the regular D2 Khaki's. If you are looking for higher quality Khaki/Chino's then I would recommend Bonobos which are twice the price but feel 100 times better than these pants.",1

I couldn't believe it! Plus, the material is super thin and cheap. Dont buy this costume for an adult male, unless they are short and VERY skinny. I would probably give this 0 stars, if I could. The only plus was the hat that came with it, which we ended up using. And don't be fooled, the axe and heart are NOT included.",1
"I sure wish I could return this bra, because it's very uncomfortable. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how uncomfortable it was until I had worn it for a day. The side supports dig into my underarms and it hurts. The side supports are supportive, but too painful to wear. Also, the cup size runs about a cup size too big.",1
"This product is a good idea, but the inflatable wings would not hold air.  The air plug would not stay put once it was fully inflated.  I also didn't realize it was inflatable-I suppose I didn't read the description well enough, but I was disappointed with the product overall.",1
Save your money!! The purple cap thing was not included. Also one you take out of the package it immediately overwhelms you with the smell of the chemicals in the plastic. Let it air out before you let your child put this on.,1

It was too small and not comfortable.,1
"the design flaw is this: at the lace holes closest to the toes it is tight. the shoe needed to have more room for the foot to enter there. regardless of whether it is the right size for the foot, it needs more room at this point. it could be a cutting mistake. I don't think it is. Perhaps you could stretch this out if you wet it. my kid does not have much arch at all and foot isn't too large for the shoe.",1
"These are definitely knock-offs.  I received the sunglasses yesterday and compared them to a pair of Persol Sunglasses I already own, and while they are a good copy they are also definitely fake.  Just to make sure I took them down to my optometrist and had him look at them and he also confirmed they are fakes (he is a big fan of Persol).  If you want real Persols you are probably going to have to pay for them.  I would hope that the folks at Persol would be made aware of the folk selling fakes of their products and do something about it as it can only give Persol a bad name.",0

"These are obviously classics. But there are two problems. The first one is the fit. After long periods of wear they start to rub against the side of the front part of my foot. This is probably due to how narrow they are. What I wonder is why my classic black and white converse chucks do not cause this issue. The second problem is that they make a sound when you are walking. Sounding something like ""thwap thwap"" which is from cloth smacking against the rubber portion of the shoe. I don't wear these often due to these two problems.",1

"I have always bought this bra or one very similar that Bali made for years.  Having bought 1/2 dozen in a sale 7 or 8 years ago I hadn't had a need to replace them until now.  I wear the same size as I did when last purchased, however I had a very hard time getting the hook and eyes to meet on this new one.  Could be that the ""fabric"" was just too new, because once it met the other side it was okay, but without any ""play"".  The straps no longer have the small elastic portion that connects to the back of the bra so adjusting the cup means you must tighten the strap rather than ""jiggle"" it for a comfortable fit.  Unfortunately once you tighten the strap you raise the cup and it throws the cleavage into a ""mound"", not pretty!  I won't send it back as I'll use it as a ""spare"", but I won't order another one.  One must really try on a bra before purchasing...every manufacturer has cheapened their product to squeeze more profit...this time it's the buyer being ""squeezed""!",1

I have worn Keen Presidio shoes for a number of years.  This was MY shoe.  I have a very narrow foot and they are perfect to accommodate my orthotics.  Now the problem....  The last pair I have ordered are so stiff I can not wear them.  They are no where near the same shoe.  The tongue is too long and very stiff to the point they rub my ankle.  The crazy part is it is only the right shoe.  The material on the outer shoe has changed.  It is fake looking.  The black pair is just plain ugly.  They look like old people shoes.  I am very disappointed and want my old style back.... Please Keen Shoes bring back the old style.,0
I knew from the other reviews this was going to be cheaply made and it really is.  I just didn't know what other alternative there was to complete my 3 year-old's tin man costume.  I'm leaving it in the package until we need it so there are no chances of it breaking beforehand.,1
"I purchased this belt in brown and black.  While the brown belt was fine, I tried on the black belt with a pair of khaki pants. The black dye from the belt bled onto my pants and is still there after several washes.  I did not expect the belts to be of high quality leather (based on the price), but I did expect to be able to wear the belt with any pair (and color) of pants without leaving a black ring around the waist of my pants.  You definitely get what you pay for.  Oh... and it took 2 full weeks for the belts to arrive.  I received a shipment email, no tracking for the package was ever available, and my emails to the seller went unanswered until after I received the belts (2 days after the estimated delivery date.)

It just look like a well polished clear glass or crystal.Picture it's just too sharp and the real one is just ""too fake"" to be a diamond one and at the same time with too big pretentions to be a simple silver ring to wear with casual-sport apparel.

"I am, and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan. I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another, someone in my home owns a pair. My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas. The picture of the unbleached pair, looked white, so I purchased them. When the box arrived, I wrapped it and placed it under the tree. Can you imagine my disappointment (and most importantly, my son's), when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck's?DO NOT BUY This unbleached color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time, sizing was as issue, as well.

Second, the outside pockets were very small. there was no description to the size or depth of the outside pockets in the product description. They won't hold a coffee travel mug or a 20 oz. water bottle without them falling out. Third, the zipper is cheap. It misaligns the teeth when zipping about every 3rd or 4th time. I would return this product if I would have been provided return information.",1

"Before I ordered this necklace I read the reviews, so I knew the necklace would be smaller than it seemed, and I was okay with that. When the necklace arrived, I loved the setting, but the stone had a crack in it right across the middle, which was very obvious and distracting. The necklace was to be an important gift, for my daughter's high school graduation and her most expensive piece of jewelry to date. I contacted the seller about the flaw and asked if I should return the piece for a refund or for a replacement. I was assured that they would happily replace the necklace for one with a better stone. I returned the necklace to Silver Insanity, and from my perspective, that's where things started to go badly. I never received the replacement necklace. When I queried Silver Insanity, they said that delivery of the necklace had been attempted, but failed, and the necklace had been returned to them. (My husband and I were at home at the time of the attempted delivery, and don't know how we missed being aware of the delivery attempt. I also wish there had been more than one attempt before the necklace was returned to the sender.) By that point I had given my daughter a different graduation gift, and since Silver Insanity already had the necklace back in their possession, I asked to be refunded the purchase price. At this point the transaction completely fell apart. It was ONE DAY after the deadline of having Amazon help me resolve the issue, and I never heard from Silver Insanity again, nor did I ever see a refund to my credit card.UPDATE: Immediately after I posted the above review, I heard from a quality assurance team member from Amazon. They contacted the seller for me and I WAS REFUNDED THE FULL AMOUNT of the purchase. TERRIFIC JOB, AMAZON! YOU WERE GREAT. I honestly don't know what went wrong with my transaction--in the beginning my contacts with the seller were very agreeable--perhaps I just let too much time pass in between my inquiries. I hate to only give the transaction one star, but I honestly don't know how else to rate the experience overall. Other people have been very satisfied.",0

"but it is so small and made of such strong material (like an ACE bandage) I could barely stretch it enough to get it over my head. When I finally did manage to maneuver it over my shoulders it was so excruciatingly tight across my upper chest, I didn't think I pull it any lower, but I couldn't get it back over my head either, so I had to continue on with it!  I did eventually manage to get it where it should be, but it was so tight and uncomfortable I could not have exercised in it.  Getting it off was another hassle and I had to wrangle it down and step out of it, as there was no going back the other way.  I would estimate that it is almost 3 sizes smaller in band size than a regular bra. When I lose 30 pounds, I will try it on again as I think it would give a lot of support. I didn't send it back because of shipping and insurance costs. It would have been helpful if the seller had stated in the product description that the bra does not actually open up in the back (or front). I should have read the reviews before purchasing (the way wised-up readers do) because I saw that several purchasers who think the bra is great actually have someone help them get into it because it is so tight.",1

Also, it difficult and cumbersome to thread the end through the loop, which you have to do every time you put the watch on.

"I discovered these sunglasses were rip offs when I had to replace one of the lenses after it broke.  After several attempts at fitting them with replacement lenses purchased from sellers on eBay, which were all too small but should have fit based on matching the model number on the temple and purchasing 52mm lenses, I finally took them to an authorized dealer.  He ordered ray ban lenses for the model number on the temple and came up with the same result, lenses that were 52mm, but were too small to fit into these frames.  He showed me that these frames have a different, deeper groove holding the lens, which have been glued in, and confirmed to me that these are fakes.  Who knows if these lenses are UV protected, but they are definitely knock offs.  Buyer beware.  I am contacting Amazon for a refund.  I would never have known these were fakes if I did not try to replace the lenses.  Be aware the lenses look identical to genuine ray ban, down to the script on one lens and ""RB"" inscribed on the other, but the lenses are glued in, and are larger than 52 mm as stated on the temple.",0

"I am keeping these but with reluctance.  I bought a pair in 2014.  Perfect right out of the box.  I would sing their praises to everyone.  Fast forward, I order from another company.  They have a tongue in them that is no longer made of leather and now made of some ""fake"" leather, stiff, unyielding.  I put them on, wear them out.  The tongue is cutting in to the front of my ankle.  Not good at all.  They also changed the material on the side of the shoe to said ""fake"" leather stuff.  The shoe is not the same.  The insole is not the same.  The back feels shorter, the shoe feels stiff.  I am so disappointed and rather shocked that a shoe with this much of a cult following would tamper with near perfection.  It has to be about money.  I would pay more for these shoes if they would return them to their original integrity.  I wrote the company.  No reply.  I called, they listened but no real answers.  As they say ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  So...for the time being, I can no longer recommend these shoes.",0

Yes, it was an unbelievable price for 6 packages (but it was like pulling teeth to get them to send me all six--they came two at a time, each time my having to write and complain that I hadn't received the full order). But EVERY SINGLE TIME I wear a new pair, by the end of day, there's a run or a snag in them. These things used to last me a very long time and I can't believe I've suddenly become extremely careless in the wearing of my knee highs. It's like I can barely get them out of the package without snagging them. So either these are knock-offs or the quality has gone way down.",1

I have 3 pairs of Ugg (boots and slippers) bought straight from their original web site. These boots felt fake the instant I touched them. The sewn in tag was not even cloth like original ugg tags. Nor did the tag look anything like the original ugg tag. The inner lining should not fall out in little tufts of fluff either. Ugg is very stern on fraud and has an entire section on their site that compares authentic uggs to fakes. These boots fit every single fraud exhibit.

"I bought this figuring it was a reasonable value for the price considering I would wear it twice.  Everything you see is delivered except for the eye patch and the sword.  As an added bonus they included realistic smell of dead fish.  I think they got confused between the fisherman and the pirate costume at the factory.What does it smell like you ask? Buy several sushi rolls from a truck on the side of the road.  Unwrap them and put them under the seat of your car.  Roll up the windows and leave it there in the hot summer sun.  Come back after a few weeks and open the car.  That should get pretty close.I read about the smell on other reviews but nothing prepared me for the horrible nauseating DEAD FISH smell that assaulted my olfactory senses when I opened the package!  This thing totally reeks. I am not sure what chemicals they are using over there in China but it surely cannot be healthy for the people who work there.The activity is tomorrow there is not really time to do anything else other than hang  it out.  Hope it kills the smell enough so I can keep my food down.It is cheap but still I would recommend against buying it.  Find something local you can try on and smell first.EDIT:As I didn't have much time, I thoroughly soaked (dripping wet) the fake leather parts in Febreeze and let them air out overnight. This included the bit of shirt detail. That seemed to knock the smell way down on all the smaller parts but not the boots. While I could still detect a slight scent of dead fish, the overriding smell was the Febreeze but that was much better than dead fish.  My event was outside so I didn't worry too much about it.The day after the event the Febreeze smell is fading and still no sign of the dead fish returning. I will likely still throw out the costume after the next event rather than store it for the future because of this underlying smell issue. But at least I found a solution to the problem.",0

They were a good price so I decided to give them a shot as I needed all black shoes for work. Also, I have one other pair of Tom's and they are comfortable so I figured why not. These were a mistake. I'm a size 7 1/2 in EVERY SINGLE SHOE I OWN. These did not even fit me. I couldn't get them on at all. My other Tom's are the same size and no issues. This leads me to believe that possibly they are fake because usually fake shoes are made in other countries and those sizes run small especially in China. Not ever cool for Amazon to allow a seller to sell fake shoes. Maybe the seller is unaware or was falsely sold these shoes as the real deal. But I do have to agree that something is off on these shoes.",0
Was a good backpack but receive a fake for my second order.Differences as follows:-The shoulder strap end has no plastic 'thing'.-The shoulder strap hold has no High Sierra logo on it. Smaller too. And the stitching too simple. No 'V' and cross stitching.-The logo of 'Suspension Strap System' also look different.-The organizational compartment key hook also smaller. The material feels cheaper too.Please check the picture and return your backpack should this happen. But in my case I cant return it because i am not from USA.Will upload photo later,0

"I purchased this as a anniversary present for my wife.  Our anniversary was in 4 days before I ordered this.  Amazon was running a promo, ""next day deliver, if I charged the purchase with my DISCOVER card"", which I did.  The $18.xx next day shipping charge was dropped.  It shipped UPS, but never made the next-day delivery, & with the Thanksgiving holiday & weekend, the delivery date was 5-days later.  I immediately contacted Amazon & had the order cancelled, as I had to purchase the watch at WALMART & wait in line at their Thanksgiving Day 8:00 PM ordeal, who had the same identical watch for just $18.00, instead of Amazon's $30.00.  I have NOT yet received my credit back on my DISCOVER card, & yesterday the UPS truck pulled-in my driveway with ""return labels"" to ship-back the watch that I never got.  I had 2 TXT messages on my cell phone from Amazon telling me to contact my local UPS so I could ""PICK-UP"" my watch?????  I don't think so.  So I am NOT rating the quality or performance of the Timex watch, just AMAZON'S sleazy shipping/handling tactics.  Actually, the watch is an identical replacement for the one my wife had, that finally stopped 'ticking' after about 8 years.",0
Purchased these Optical White converse through Amazon Prime Wardrobe. I am fairly certain they are fake. The logo doesn't have a star in the 'O' and the box is all wrong. Even the tissue paper feels different. Returning these.,0

"I bought this as a birthday gift for  a friend.  There are a lot of good things about it but unfortunately an overwhelming bad thing.  The wallet is a very good design with  lots of credit card,etc. slots.  The cards go into the slots easily which is a big plus.  One part of the wallet was stitched in crooked.  Its not terrible but is noticeable.  Now,  the real big problem .  The wallet has a TERRIBLE odor.  I have worked on this problem for several weeks.  I have aired it out.  I've wiped it with dryer sheets.  I've sprayed it with Orange Pledge.  I've used Febreze on it.  Nothing has worked.  I decided it wasn't worth sendng the wallet back but I did not give it to my friend  so the whole thing was a waste.  So sorry to have to report this.",1
"I bought these glasses to replace the ones that I had accidentally lost on a boating trip. I had actually Made in Italy Ray Bans. These were advertised as authentic ray bans and the image of the glasses even says made in italy on the glasses. However, I received my glasses and they were made in CHINA!!! Guess what, Ray Ban doesn't make glasses in China they make them in Italy and have since 1937. So these are not Authentic, they are FAKE! I contacted Amazon, spoke with a supervisor, and guess what...they can't do anything other than to refund my money. No accountability for this lying seller who sells fake Ray Bans just refund my money. So not only am I done with buying from Amazon, as this is not the first issue I've had with them, but I am just going to suck it up and pay the extra money and buy the Ray Bans from Ray Ban's site. Complete BS and the folks at Amazon were hardly any help at all. If you want real Ray Bans don't buy from this seller.",0

"There seems two issues with my ray ban aviator sunglasses with gold frame and green lenses. First, a small strip on the right eye lens toward the bottom is not coated. Well I don't know if it is a coating or something else, but the small strip is clear, not the greenish color and is clearly different from the rest part of the lens. Second, there is no ""RB"" etching on the left lens (the one that does not have the white rayban printed logo). I read on various websites which all advise that authentic pairs should have the RB etching. So I do feel that the pair I received is fake. This is very suprising to me as I bought them directly from amazon, not from any 3rd party reseller.",0

"What ever happened to the quality  Buxton was famous for?  I remember getting my first Buxton bag at the age of 12, almost 50 years ago.  It was black, thick soft rich and I even remember the smell of good quality leather.  this bag pales by comparison.  The leather is thin and cheap, and there are so many pockets, it looks like 3 organizers put together.  I didn't send this one back but I should have, as it is a constant reminder of how things ""used to be"".  I have another red bag with a handle that's too short, so have been using the one off this bag as a substitute.  It will likely go to the local ""Bibles for Missions"" goodwill. Would not recommend at all.",1

I've never had a genuine YKK zipper crap out on me, and now TWO of them in just a few months?! Something is not right.Good sweatshirt, but it's useless without a zipper, and these are not YKK zippers based on my decades of experience. I don't know what's going on with these zippers.",0

This shirt is about a foot longer than necessary. Its ridiculously long.,1
They look extremely fake! They are not held together by anything and fell apart as soon as I took them out. And also the smoke is barely visible! I have ordered other fake ones from a different company and everything was better the quality was amazing! They also get all nasty when you put it in your mouth!,0
This product sucks!! I think they are probably fake. I wore them two times and on the second time the thong part separated from the sandal. Too bad I am outside of the 30 day return policy. I will never order this product again.,0

"Amber is beautiful but these Amber gemstones are really very very small. All three stones that I received fit on one single dime!The second picture of the product description shows a dime next to 3 (small) Amber gemstones. They mention ""very small"" in their description but looking at the picture, I got the impression that the size of one of the gemstones would be roughly a bit smaller than a dime (why else using this picture in the description?) I definitely did not expect that all three Amber gemstones would easily fit together on one single dime, and that there would still be space enough that you can read the word Liberty! It would have been okay with me when there had been at least one ""very small"" gemstone (like the pictured ones) together with two tiny sized ones in the little red mash bag that I received. So I can not say ""it's okay"" = 3 stars, and due to the misleading picture it is just 2 stars. I attached two photos of the gemstones that I received to show you their size. Look at the size of a dime and see what you get.",1

"I have owned several Ray-Ban aviators (both small metal and large metal 58 mm) and I ordered all of them on Amazon. This maybe a fake one or a very bad quality authentic one. I found one defect right out of the box before trying them on. The last letter ""P"" on the left frame(right beside the temple length number 135 and for mine it is supposed to say ""3P"") looked suspicious because it kind of looked like it got scratched off. But I neglected this fact and was thinking about keeping them since the box, the soft cloth and the sunglasses looked ok. But later on the same day I received these sunglasses, I noticed 2 white, tiny dots: one on the upper side of the right lens and another one very close the right upper frame. I tried to remove it with a soft cloth but it did not go away.(see it in the photos!). It seemed like some of the white paint from the logo got stuck on the other part of the right lens. And again I tried to scratch those off lightly with my nails but they wouldn't go away. This is a huge disappointment for me. I cannot say whether these are original or fake ones but there is no way I am keeping these because of these defects.I ordered the same exact sunglasses(55 mm) directly sold by Amazon a few years ago for a friend of mine and I had no doubt about the authenticity of that one and the price was much lower for a flawless piece. Ray-Ban needs to strictly control their quality standards on their products or Amazon should stop letting the sellers sell low quality products to its customers.",0

They also stated that they would be contacting their supplier about the lack of a stamp on the ring and have proven themselves, in my eyes, to be an honorable company.

I decided to continue with the order since it was a good price and the actual product description only said SHEARLING; never mentioned anything about FAUX FUR or fake shearling fur. Unfortunately my amazon invoice turned out to be accurate. This boot IS made with fake fur - not real shearling - contrary to the amazon product title and description. If you're looking for a genuine shearling boot, this pair isn't the one for you. I tried on the boots when they arrived and they felt very stiff and uncomfortable to walk in.

The second one ordered was an add-on item, so I had to order more stuff tor receive it..no problem.  However, when I started the return process for the 2XL, they want $5.44 shipping on a $9.75 item.  So I guess I am keeping something that doesn't fit.  Not happy about that.  So the review is more about sizing issue and return policy.  I think this support would have worked great if I had the right size.  Oh well.",1

"I bought 4 packs of these at Target, two in black, two in natural. The color was fine, black was a little sheerer than I expected, natural made my pale legs look naturally tanned. The reason I'm giving them one star is because EVERY SINGLE PAIR got runs after the first use. Embarrassing. The fabric is cheap, and I was actually appalled at the difference when I compared these with my trasparenze and JC Penny tights.Won't ever buy these again, complete waste of $40. I'd rather buy one pair of $20 tights that will last for months than two of these that won't last one use. JC Penny makes amazing tights that last much longer. I think the brand is called Sheer Caress. H&M also makes really nice tights, but I have long legs and I always felt that the crotch of them sits a little too low for me. Trasparenze is also a nice brand, but they also run a little small and can't take a beating like the JC Penny ones.",1
"The problem with these shorts is that the waist is cut unusually high. When I first put them on and the material was quite stiff the waistband was at my belly button instead of one inch below.

I could have worn the size 1 easily because these are so soft and stretchy. They felt fake, so I read tags & there is only 1 that says Levi's, the rest, even the hanging tag, don't say Levi's.

"When you tap the lenses they should feel like glass and make the *clink* sound. The frames appear to be real but the lenses are obviously plastic especially when I held them up next to a pair of sunglasses my friend got from the official Ray Bans website. The frames appear to be legit, but the writing of Ray Bans on the lenses and just the quality of the lenses overall make me worried. The lenses are also very light in color. I know that the lenses should not be 100% opaque, but you can clearly see my eyes right through these. Also, no serial number or anything to ensure authenticity on the box. First red flag when I received them was that the box did not look new or well packaged. It was wrinkled and worn down on the corners. Again with no markings. So yes the frame looks nice, but when I paid for these I wanted them mostly for the lenses. That is the point of sunglasses after all. I know Ray Bans are a highly counterfeited product, so I am returning these and sprung to buy another pair from the Ray Bans website like I should have done in the first place. Be very critical of the lenses. It is easy for manufacturers of fake glasses to put fake lenses into real frames.",0

"I ordered this backpack because I was looking for a cute, nontoxic backpack for my 3-year-old son. When I opened the package, I was immediately assaulted by a really strong plastic smell. I assumed that it must be the plastic bag it was wrapped in, because the product description says ""100% cotton"" three times, and other reviews have complained about the lack of lining. Nope, the interior of the backpack is completely lined in a very smelly, shiny plastic material; the little zip pocket doesn't even have the hint of cotton on the interior. Additionally, the adjustable buttonholes are useless, because the top buttonholes are sewed too small to fit the button. Now I have to decide if I want to try to disappoint my very excited son (it really is a cute backpack) AND fight with the Amazon Marketplace seller (who informed me that the ""in-stock item"" would not be available for months, and then informed me that it was available but would take two weeks), or just deal with an overpriced, smelly backpack with bad buttonholes.

"I was expecting a good watch from this seller, I thought I can trust in somebody with a beautyful web, discountwatchstore.com, but I was wrong, the real life is other thing....The watch had come in a very beautyful box, had many stickers as gifts, with all, and beautyful....The problem and the real life started when I saw the watch....The watch is a total fake, in everything is evident the false...., and I know that very well by 3 reasons:1) I have 4 Invicta's watches, so I can recognize easily a real Invicta.2) The number wich represent the date, at 3 o'clock, is a stupid fake, always is 9!!  9 of november, and in the next month is 9 of december, etc, will be always right for one day each month...The rest of the year will be wrong!!!!3) The rest...., the word INVICTA at the side is in a poor cut and a different style of the real Invicta's.  And the brand have the word Invicta in the down side at all the lenght.I don't know none Invicta with that virtue.I told to the seller about the watch, and this told me that the watch is real, that they don't carry none fake watch, but they know they are liers...., what for to lie?Will they continue with that absurd cinism?Probably, probably, somebody sent a fake watch and taked the real, a bad employee will say them, but I don't believe that.The seller told me that they will refund me all if I send them all intact as I received.  I hope this be sincere for evit the collapse of his own web just for one watch.I can't believe how somebody can lost time, why don't sell original watches?  What have that of bad?  Is a sin?Would be a good businees too.I am now just waiting that the seller refund me totally. I hope that because if no, they will have problems for continue selling in Amazon.Ah!!!  Please, if you think in buy any watch to this seller, or if you bought, be really carefull in the unboxing because there is a tag wich say something as: ""Won't be returnable if this tag is damaged""WTF???  Why??  Is just a paper, sure, is a pretext....Well, I will write again later about the refund politic of the company.By now they looks to refund the watch, they sent me a mail where say I have to impress something and with that ship the watch by USPS and this won't be charged.  I hope the USPS know something about that when i ship that...I have a complete video review, but I won't put this until the seller attack me of lier or something.Because I really was expecting something good from that seller, because I almost bought other watch from this seller in the past. The web of the seller is really good...., but now you know, you have to be careful and check at other side....And I was near to buy a watch of almost$1.500 but I decided to analize a simpler watch from this.Well. I will ship back the watc in january 2011 because I am traveling, I hope the time don't be a pretext of the seller for  don't refund.Thanks for your time friends.  Check again for my feedback about the refunds politics ,and facts, of this seller.",0

These TOMS are absolute fakes. They are extremely uncomfortable. Run too small and too narrow. There are marks from a marker on the soles. Really poorly made.

"I am a nurse, which means Im on my feet must of a twelve hour shift. Have had Merrells since 2002, love them, never had any problems with them unlit now. This pair that I bought has had problems. First the left shoe  squeaks  not a big deal by any stretch but can get on your nerves after twelve hours. Second, and much worse that the squeak is the fact that the right shoe sole is falling off by the toe. Because of this these shoes start to hurt after a few hours in them. As you can guess a shift with hurting feet is no fun at all. Will continue to buy Merrells but will be leery from here on in.",1
"I was very disappointed with this item as I had ordered them for my grand daughter's birthday and ordered them to arrive well before that date. I had ordered womens size 8 and was sent mens size 8. I now have to re order with no possible chance of receiving them before her birthday. The quality of the Converse shoes was good but clearly not very accurate shipping staff.  Most disappointing.This hurts more as I paid $7.99 in the original order for shipping and now have to pay $7.99 to return them.  If I reorder them thats another $7.99.  H. ThorpeAfter contacting the company, Lastpairs replaced the shoes for the size I had ordered and sent me a prepaid envelope to send the wrong ones back to them.However when I included in my email acknowledgement of receipt of the package I added:- ""If all is correct this time I will add a note to my review that all has been corrected save the aggravation of the whole thing.""

"I was looking for neon sunglasses to purchase for a prom event for teens.  I specifically did not want ""neon sunglasses"" from oriental trading because they seemed low quality and were cheap looking online. When I found these on amazon, that specifically had ""dark lenses"" and were an affordable price, I ordered them. I got what I paid for--what should I expect when I buy 4 pairs of sunglasses for $6. However, what was most disappointing is that each of the sunglasses came in a plastic bag with an oriental trading sticker on it. Had I known these were oriental trading sunglasses, I would not have purchased them. I think it should be noted in the product description somewhere that they are selling oriental trading sunglasses. Also, the product says they are ""dark lenses"" and they are not--you can still through them.I guess I shouldn't have expected to get more when I'm paying essentially $1.50 for a pair of sunglasses.

The elastic band was not mentioned in the product description. I am allergic to latex and did not realize there was latex elastic. I am extremely unhappy that the latex was not mentioned as I had an allergic reaction to the shoes.3. I spent about $80 on them and they don't feel like $80 shoes. The trends don't grip very well, there is not much arch support, and the leather is thin.4. There was a lot of ""toe cleavage""Overall, I am extremely unimpressed and unhappy with this product. I have returned the shoes and don't plan to order from Hush Puppies ever again. The one saving grace was that Amazon made it very easy for me to return the shoes",1

The black pair leather above the toe crinkle up and looks like plastic instead of leather.  I bought Stacy Adams years ago and the shoe lasted a decade. I bought three pairs within three months and they are ready for the trash.  I am not sure what happened to this brand,",1

"When I ordered this product I was expecting and hoping for a smimilar quality to the WigWam socks I bought on this site earlier. I was very dissapointed when I got these. I boutght these socks for hiking on cold days. The socks are not as thick or warm as the WigWam and feel less like wool than acrylic. There is not enough cushioning at the heel and sole. The weave of the material is very inconsistant too (some socks are ""nubbier"" than others) so the overall color is a bit different from sock to sock. Out of the six socks I received, I couldn't match any two to make a pair. All, in all, I think the quality of these socks is definitley not worth the $5plus per pair that I paid. The seller should mention on the product description that these socks are ""seconds"" or ""odd lots"".",1

This is the second time I ordered this Buxton wallet. Same color even.  First one was great and lasted several years. So I ordered a second one.  One week later the zipper came apart.  Last time for me.  I still use the wallet without the change purse zipper.  Hate it but will eventually see one in a store that I can buy.  NO MORE of these.  Sad because all my life I've loved Buxton leather wallets.  In Southern California I could find them in department stores.  Retired and living in a very rural area of Kentucky now so it's hard to find a lot of things.  I use Amazon often but no longer for wallets.,1

"Ordered the same size as a very old pair I had and loved for years.  Wish Merrell's came in wider widths.  The toe box was snug but okay--just too tight over the arch and toward ankle.  Too tight for a break in period to make comfortable, I'm afraid.  Will have to return the shoes.",1
i have the original that they sold 5 or 6 years ago and now i have this one and it is not the same at all. i gave this one to my little brother and he cut his hand after just a few days of using it he showed me the edges and they are really sharp. the clip is also smaller than the one i use and doesnt have the slim clip logo on the metal like mine either it is either a fake or slim clip started getting cheap with there manufactoring either way don't get this i still like the concept but i feel there are better money clips out there to bad they don't make them like mine anymore ill make sure to keep this one in good condition so it will last me.,0

Had to return those as well. I'm done buying Merrell online~",1
Fit strange . Don't think they are actual sanuks...it's like they are fake or are defective. ..and..that's why they are so cheap. Would be better to try and catch a sell at a surf shop...atleast you know they are real and will fit right,0
These are fake! Do not buy them. The inside is shearling but the outside fur is fake! The sole is stiff and hard. Returning immediately. I bought some from Nordstrom for my sister in law and decided to order some for my roommate. I ordered of it Amazon because the shipping was faster. I had them side by side and these look like dingy cheap stiff garbage compared to the real uggs.,0

"After recieving these they looked very cheap for 150$ glasses, then after some research on how to spot fake Oakleys they failed every test. They infact have screws in the hinges, which Oakleys never does. They have made in china stamped on the inside of arms, all Oakleys are made in U.S.A. The paint on the O over ears rubbed off easily, fakes use a screen printing process that rubs off easy. The warranty card isn't even included, it has a cheap piece of paper with no contact information on it, not the plastic card included on real oakleys. Bottomline these look good for fakes, but you might aswell just buy 10$ walmart glasses and paint a o on the side.",0

"I DID NOT GET REAL UGGSIf I had gotten real Uggs I'd have been super happy with this purchase. Real Uggs are great and I ended up getting a pair of real ones for my wife via the official Uggs website. But the Uggs I got via this listing had several problems that made me question their authenticity. Here are some things you need to watch out for.... Real Uggs have a tag inside the left boot that has a hologram and a QR code that when scanned should take you to the official Uggs website with a verification that that code was put on an authentic Uggs product, telling you exactly what kind of boots the code is for (style, color, etc) On the pair I got the hologram was missing from that tag and the QR code took me to the Uggs website but there was no record of that tag on file. (Note, some Uggs produced in 2014 didn't have the hologram sticker per their website, but the QR code should still work.) There is another QR code sticker on the box. It should also work and I believe it should match the code in the boots. The one on the box I got was a different code and also didn't work. There apparently should be an oval sticker on the box with another hologram on it. The box my boots came in did not have that sticker either. The boots should be genuine sheepskin, making the fur inside very durable and VERY soft. The fur inside the boots I got was not very soft. It was more like dog fur. Not super rough, but not super soft either. Plus when I rubbed my hand inside many strands of it came off and stuck to my hand. That should not happen. From handling the boots the blue dye (I got blue boots) was coming off on my fingers. Not a ton, but more than it should. The sole wasn't quite thick enough compared to other Ugg boots. It was close, but not quite perfect.I could overlook any one of these things and assume it was some kind of random irregularity, but when I put them altogether it was too much to ignore. They weren't obvious fakes that you could spot from a mile away, but if they are sold as authentic I expect them to be authentic.DEFFINATELY FAKES WHEN COMPARED TO BOOTS DIRECTLY FROM UGGSo I returned these and Amazon was awesome about it. They took all kinds of details from me about the issues and had my money refunded as soon as UPS tracking showed the return was picked up.I got new Uggs directly from the official Uggs site. Same style and size, and now I'm completely convinced the ones I had gotten previously were fakes. The fur is MUCH softer, noticeably so without any question and it doesn't come off when I touch it. No blue dye came off on my hands either. The authenticity hologram sticker was on the tag inside the left boot and on the box, and the care instructions inside the box were much more detailed.And there was a 3rd card inside the box with instructions on how to authenticate the boots, basically with all the details from the Uggs website about the hologram tags and materials quality, etc.... Shockingly, the fake boots didn't include that card at all. So that's a pretty big red flag that I didn't even know to look for originally. Make sure yours have that card.I am NOT saying that you shouldn't buy your Uggs here on Amazon. I am sure that the vast majority of Uggs sold on this listing are legit. But mine were definitely not legit. It only takes one unscrupulous seller to ruin an entire listing like this. And the seller I bought them from was listed on the Ugg website as an authorized retailer. But who knows if that authorized retailed was actually the seller on Amazon or if someone just set up a fake Amazon store and used an authorized retailed name?This review is meant as a guide to help you properly authenticate the boots you get to make sure you're getting what you paid for.",0

"Anybody else suspicious that there are SO MANY reviews about bras?  My guess is that the manufacturers are in a war to fake the most positive reviews and are also dissing the competition's products.  Anyway, this bra, like so sports bras, won't help full-figured women to minimize bounce.  It is lightweight and will help reduce sweating becuse the cups are separated, but it does nothing to minimize movement -- which is a key factor in a sports bra for full-figured women.",0

"I have been wanting a pair of timberlands for the longest but I couldn't find them anywhere after this past Christmas. I finally found them and made my purchase here on Amazon. I absolutely loved them but they we're just too small. I had to send them back and the company, shoe parlor, ran out of the size I needed very quickly. I wear between an 8 and 8 1/2 in women's shoes. I ordered a 5.5 Big Kid because someone told me they run big. I requested a 6 and they told me they did not have it. I'm sad about it but I guess it's not meant to be.",1
"I've always been a fan of Merrell shoes, they're great for walking and look good too, in either home-casual or work-casual situations. I walk 2-5 miles a day, to and from work, so a good pair of Merrells suits both the walk and the office. EXCEPT for this pair of Jungle Mocs. They're shoddily made and the soles squeak like I'm walking on live mouse insoles. I hoped maybe it was just a ""new"" thing, so I still wore them several times... apparently I hoped too long and now Amazon won't let me return them. I'd like to think this pair was a defective fluke, but I'm afraid Merrell quality may have gone out the window.",0

"Please do not buy from this seller.  The wallet I bought my sister for her 61st birthday was defective.  The flap underneath the gold piece on the coin purse was never glued in.  It was not noticeable at first since most things are paid with a credit card.  However, as she began to gradually fill the coin purse section with coins--and it didn't take many--the flap slipped out from underneath the gold coin purse clasp.  You can see that it was NEVER glued AT ALL!  This company issued a $10 credit for a wallet that is useless.  The wallet should have been replaced.  My sister has now gone back to using her 10 year old Buxton wallet!  This wallet is sitting in a box looking brand new but totally unusable.  Do not buy from this seller!",1

"At first glance, these appeared to be a normal pair of pre-washed black 501s, with the familiar cardboard tags, however on closer inspection, the fabric was very thin, with a very un-denim-like texture, the rivets were black rather than copper colored, and most tellingly the red tag on the right hip pocket did not say ""Levis"". ALL genuine Levis have the red tag, and they ALWAYS have the word ""LEVIS"" printed on them. The jeans were also weirdly wrinkled along the front of the crotch and top of thighs, as though the wrinkles were deliberately induced, but the texture was sort of stiff and crackly. I'm pretty sure these are counterfeit Levis. We sent them back for credit, ordered another pair of black 501s from another vendor and got a normal, correct pair of 501s with all the expected attributes.This vendor should be looked into for selling fake merchandise.",0

When I attempted to return it I was told to pay shipping as it was not the seller's fault. $16.00 UPS ground for a $22 shirt. It appears the email response I got when I submitted a complaint possibly came from overseas, poorly written, no capital letters, etc. Stay away from this company or be prepared to pay shipping costs if something is not right !",1
Slow delivery. Shoes were a little small. I would suggest ordering a half size up. Leather almost looks a little fake. Not fully sure if they are the real thing.,0
"I haven't actually put the tights on yet but when I first took it out of the packaging, it smelled a little odd. I follow the principle that it's always good to wash clothing items before I wear them. I hand-washed these tights using some gentle handsoap. The first thing I noticed was that the nylon smells like vomit. I kid you not . I thought that this was only when it was wet, because some fabrics have an odd smell when they are wet, but even after I hang-dried these tights for 24 hours, they still smelled this way. Therefore, I am soaking them in laundry detergent and water right now, hoping that the smell will go away. I wouldn't purchase this again because I have a sensitive nose!",1
"I found these to be huge, far bigger than a size 6.  I have ordered in the past from jockey and found I liked their products and so ordered another style in a smaller size to try once more.  I hope these fit and are not so old fashioned.",1
I have washed these shorts time and time again. They will not stop bleeding red. This is the 8th time I have to buy new t-shirts because these shorts have bleed so much.,1
"I bought a pair of these from the Cole Haan website.  I really like how the Dark Roast Grain color looks in the Cole Haan product photos, and I was pretty disappointed when I finally saw them in person.  The actual color is an extremely uniform dark, chocolate brown, and the slight sheen makes the leather look almost like plastic.  The Amazon product photos look more like the actual shoe.  I'm hoping with a bit more wear, the leather will break in and start looking more like the Cole Haan photos.In terms of comfort, these are probably the least comfortable shoes that I own.  Again, I'm hoping that everything will soften up as the shoes break in.  The soles feel very hard and the heels seem unusually high for men's dress shoes.  The product description mentions Grand. OS cushioning, but these Carters are no where near as comfortable as my Cole Haan Cranston boots.  Additionally, the bottom of the heels felt like they were slightly angled until I wore them down a bit.  At first, the angle of the heels was pronounced enough that I could actually rock back onto the heels.The worst part is that the right shoe in my pair has developed a squeak after about two days of wear.  I believe it's coming from the sole of the shoe, but no amount of flexing or scuffing has made a difference to the squeak.  I bought these as final sale, and I've already worn the shoes to the point where I couldn't return them anyways, so my only hope is that they'll break in nicely.",1
"In early December I left a rather glowing review, in which I rated the 8926 at five stars. Because of the beauty of the watch and outside construction, I was still going to rate it two stars, but I'm so disappointed with Invicta's warranty policy that I can only give one.Well, my erstwhile trustworthy 8926 stopped tonight (January 22) at 9:01 p.m. The second hand froze at almost exactly 30 seconds, and manually winding it doesn't help. In fact, if I wind it manually, the second hand will vary between 29 and 31 seconds, depending on in which direction gravity is pulling it. The nice thing about the clear back is that it shows me the automatic movement isn't working at all. When I move it around to try to see if that would restart it, the rotor seems to be swinging a little *too* freely. Right now I have it rotating in a watch winder, which isn't helping either.So now I have to pay to send it in to Invicta, plus include a check for $15 for them to ship it back? Bleh! I'm just going to write off the $70 and buy a different brand, maybe the Bulova Marine Star (the imitation of the Omega Seamaster). It's too bad, Invicta, because you made a really beautiful watch here, and it's solidly constructed -- at least on the outside.Maybe I jinxed myself, telling a friend last night how it's a great watch. I was thinking to surprise him with one for his birthday, but now...Original review follows now...I was browsing Amazon for gift ideas when I came across the Invicta 8926 and felt strangely attracted to it. After initially deciding I had enough watches (can a man truly say that anyway?), I woke up one morning and placed the order. Now that I've had it for a week, how I regret not discovering it a year ago. It's a better value, and pleases me so much more, than a dressier Kenneth Cole I bought that was discounted down to about the same price. The Invicta 8926 is a watch that can complement just about any outfit, casual or dressy, short of a tuxedo.I would have given this four stars because of a few complaints, but I really have to give FIVE because of the price. A week later, I'm still blown away by the look, the feel, and that I paid only $69.99! To top off the wonderful buying experience, I ordered it on Sunday, and the ""Free super saver shipping"" got it to me on Thursday. Superb, Amazon.So far it's been accurate to within several seconds a day, but I want to be more accurate and start keeping a daily log of gains/losses and my level of activity that day. Maybe I've just been luckier to get one with a better factory-tuned regulator, or that I typically wear the watch for 12 hours and then let it sit for 12. Some have rightfully pointed out that the product description merely gives the movement as ""automatic,"" and that Amazon should be more specific that it's Japanese. However, I figured that at this price, I certainly wouldn't be getting Swiss. Nowadays there's not a lot of difference, anyway, not unless you want an exceptionally accurate automatic that will cost far more than $70-$100.Fit and finish are excellent, even when compared to more expensive watches. The cover for where the bracelet meets the case could be better aligned with the lugs: they're slightly ""sunken"" compared to the bracelet, but people will notice that as much as they'll notice a car door 1/16"" out of alignment. The mirror-polished center of the links are scratch-prone, but unless you really scrape against something hard, it's doubtful it'll be noticeable either. Also, polishing compound and a Dremel with polishing felt wheel will take care of most surface scratches -- just be careful not to polish up the brushed-finished surfaces and ruin that gorgeous two-toned effect. Now, for those with more active lifestyles, might I suggest certain metal polishes available in auto stores, which leave a thin polymer coating that absorbs microscratches.My own complaints: presumably the purpose of the 8926's date magnifier is to further mimic the actual Rolex Submariner, because goodness knows the ""cyclops"" is functionally useless (perhaps only +15% as someone else said). Invicta should simply use a flat crystal and let the watch stand on its own stylistic merits. Second, Invicta needs to make the foldover clasp easier to undo. After a week, it's been a literal pain on my thin fingernails. Third, as others have complained, the bezel is a bit stiff, so if you don't get an 8926 with the original coin-edge bezel, the ""scalloped"" style is hard to turn.Some have complained about Invicta's customer service, which appears inexcusable. I read most of the 120+ (!) reviews prior to placing my order, and I was hesitant because of the few one-stars, but I figured that the 8926 is a somewhat disposable watch. If this lasts me a couple of years, I'll be happy and might upgrade to Invicta's 9937.",1

 Horrible product seller return .Product attach Suunto core watch advertised .,0
I received this as a gift and was very disappointed in the product. The picture on the product page and the accompanying video both show the inscription to be very legible. If you go down to the product description you will find that the dimensions are .67 x. 58 inches. There is no way I will be letting my sister know that what she chose as a nice sentiment on a necklace can't be read. It just looks like bumps around the edge of the necklace. The necklace is a cheap piece of metal with a stamped inscription that is only readable if you put it on a copier and enlarge it.

The hat came damaged- squished in transit. The hat is also HUGE!  It's too big for me!Bottom line -- it's super small and don't expect the hat to be usable for a child.  It's cute if it fits.,1

I think this is a fake Casio. I had the same model but black face for 7 yrs and was great. This model I initially returned because it was leaking water when I surfed. Fortunately it was still within 30 days so I had it replaced. The replacement broke within 60 days. Piece of junk and fake Casio !,0

"The product description says it has FLIX. The product picture shows it has FLIX (see the print on lower wrist band). But the product I received does not have FLIX --- no indication on the lower band, no description in the printed instructions. I turned on the night mode and shook my hands off, the indglo never turned on by itself. Tried regular mode and it did not turn on either.Then I double checked the product description, it clearly says FLIX feature included. So I requested for a replacement. Amazon quickly ordered the same model again. I was afraid that they would send me the same product again, wasting their resources and my time, so I called Amazon --- unfortunately, the representative could not confirm whether the new shipment has FLIX, nor could she start an investigation about possible mis-description of product on the website. She said an investigation occurs only after 14 people have complained or a replacement did not solve the problem. I just wasted 30 minutes my time ....Update: the replacement came in fast enough to disappoint me: identical to the first one! Called Amazon a couple days later on 11/1/13, then I was told they would begin reviewing the product. Now am extremely disappointed by how incompetent they are in solving a simple issue like this -- how hard is it to find a watch that matches the description. This totally changed my view about Amazon -- once a great company in my mine... that has become history.",1

"Not the bag advertised!As many other reviewers have written, I was also seeking the Small Classic 6x9x17 as advertised. I paid an extra $150+ to order the bag from The Jungle Store, because they specifically claimed to sell the much sought after Classic Small AmeriBag, 9 wide. Nine inches.But it's a fake out. They shipped the newly designed 11 wide bag that so many people have complained about. This really bothers me. The Jungle Store must know that customers want the older, classic small bag, and they used those magic words in their Amazon ad. They also claimed 6x9x17 in the product description, quite incorrect.But they shipped me the much bigger, heavier, 11 bag.My sweetie is a small woman who loves her old beat-up Small Classic Nylon AmeriBag. I wanted to get her an updated beautiful leather replacement. Not to be.I noticed that other sellers had the larger redesigned leather AmeriBag for only $118.00, but they listed the real width of 11. So I foolishly bought the bag from The Jungle Store which claimed to have the bag in the more desirable 9 wide size, paying over $150 more for the size I wanted. They got my money. And I do NOT have the bag I expected.As others have noted, this oversized bag is well made, good looking. In my opinion the leather is slightly too thin to be the full grain leather, more likely a very nice top grain leather. It is a really nice bag. If only it were the real Small Classic bag.",0
"I ordered this item with high expectations, because the reviews for both the seller, and the product were good. When I received the product I was expecting a brand name slipper.

I wouldn't suggest wearing this slipper to anyone! It fits as expected, and is comfortable, but it is cheap ,and not anything like the description.",1

I recently have greater need for a watch and not just my iPhone, so I had the battery replaced today.  The watch ran for two hours and stopped again.  I set it again, but don't expect it to run longer than before.  It's too late for a return, of course.

"BUYERS BEWARE. I bought 2 identical pairs of glasses ( Oakley Radar 09-748 ) from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller but Amazon LLC. I was very very disappointed to receive 2 clearly and obviously different pairs of glasses. Now when you order 2 of the same type of BRAND NEW item from Amazon you would expect to receive 2 products that are, well the same. However the lenses were clearly different, the boxes were different, the packaging inside the boxes were different, the only thing that was the same was the frames. Not sure how this can be if i ordered 2 brand new identical products.First off there was a "" P "" sticker on the fake lenses. Now some lenses from oakley have the p sticker to indicate polarized, however i did not order polarized and the lenses were not labeled polarized on the bottom right corner of the lenses that everyone knows oakley has, so why was there a "" P "" sticker on my non polarized lenses?Secondly the Oakley labels in the middle of the lenses were clearly different. The lettering was different and on 1 pair there was a trademark r after oakley, and another there was not, just the regular oakley label. Again not sure how this can be if I order 2 identical pairs of Brand New glasses.Third the lenses were very loose on the fake oakley's, you could squeeze the bottom of the lens and the top of the frame and there was tons of movement with the fake oakley's. The real oakley's lens did not move at all.Fourth the boxes and paperwork inside the boxes were different. 1 was wrapped in plastic and 1 was not. Amazon LLC really let me down on this order.",0
"I have worn Danskos for 13 years and for all of that time I've been a size 38. When these shoes came I was so excited, they are so cute, but they are about 4/5 the width of my foot. I could barely get them on, but I really wanted them so I tried walking up and down my hall. The top of the boot pressed down on the top of my shoe and I have no arches (I have flat feet). My husband suggested they would stretch out, but after 5 minutes my feet were throbbing and I had to take them off fast. Throbbing feet from 5 minutes is not what I know Danskos to be. My experience of a Dansko is that I put them on, even brand new, and my feet rejoice. These shoes are impostors. Beautiful, but fake. I hope this is a fluke and not a Dansko trend of giving up comfort for style.",0

"My son is 3 years old and wears a size 3T.  He's about 34 lbs and 37 1/2 inches tall.  He is not tall, or heavy, actually is is on the smaller-side according to my pediatrician.  That said, I bought a size 4-6x, based on the advice in other reviews.  This is waaaay to small.  I will need to return it.  The jumpsuit/costume is exactly the right length for his height, but it is tight all over.  And because the fabric is so flimsy, my son would need to wear street clothes under it, which would make it even tighter.  Also, the ears hat is so small the ties wouldn't reach under his chin!  It looked ridiculous...Like it was made for a doll.  I am not happy with this costume and I will be returning it right away.  I advise not even trying it.  Don't buy it, if your little wants to dress up like Mickey Mouse, find another costume/brand.  This one is terrible.",1
"These Ray Bans are fakes. I'm sure it's illegal to call these real.

"This is probably the worst tool I have ever purchased! At first glance out of the box I though it was pretty good but not for long. It comes with many little tips that you plug into the tool to fit the notches in the back plate of your watch. The inside of the fake wood box (No big deal) has a custom foam bottom with a cutout matching the shape of the tool and a bunch of holes were the tips were supposed to be inserted. The foam is very weak and it did not hold the tips in place during shipping. Again, you would think no big deal but what happened is that some of the tips (three or four) got jammed in between the two metal plates of the tool and I had to get another tool to pry them out. The tips should be in a little plastic bag when shipped and then you can store them in the foam storage holes. OK your probably thinking is this guy nuts? Well last but not least, two of the the three sockets that the tips are supposed to plug into, had little round retaining springs in them to hold the tips in firmly, one did not have the spring. All of the tips fit into the one that didn't have the retainer spring but have a very loose fit and can fall out. The tips do not plug into the other two sockets that have the retainer springs AT ALL! Some of the tips are poorly finished with metal flashing that has to be ground off. The tool is not usable as is. I can probably modify it and get it to work. The design of the tool is fine. There are two adjustments for the tip spacing and the tool itself seems to be made with strong metal parts. I would much prefer to pay more for a tool not made in China that was made with quality and that you could use out of the box without repairing or having to modify it. This could have been a fluke so if you can't find a better one you could take a chance on it because it's so cheap. It's so cheap that it's not worth the trouble to return it. Maybe that's how they make money. NO RETURNS, EVER!",0

"No. No, no, no, no! These were the most granny lunchlady bras I've ever set eyes on. I tried it on as soon as it arrived, and was horrified to see myself in some 50's horror show with missile boobs. Who would even wear such a bra? Who wants their breasts to look like teepees? Certainly not me. Also, I'm a relatively thin 31-year-old. My bras do NOT require four hooks in the back. Honestly...It's a bit much. It would take me longer to put on and fasten this bra than it would for me to put on the remainder of my clothing.If you're a large-chested, non-sexually active geriatric, this is the bra for you! The rest of us need something a little more flattering.",1

I'm not sure that this is a genuine Kikkerland product. My original Kikkerland umbrella's quality is so much better that surely this one is a fake. Not only the quality of the materials used inferior to the original there is also no identifying Kikkerland name on it anywhere unlike my original which has it on the securing strap. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you have had an original one. If you haven't then you won't know the difference and may be happy.,0

"While I like the lightness of this watch that I actually wear frequently.  All the other reviews I agree with in this regard.However, the quality I found is ""You get what you pay for.""  After about 1 year, which incidentally is the Warranty Period, the watch started falling apart.  First, the little tab on the clasp broke off.  Then, one of the dial markers (the 7-o'clock marker) popped out and was floating around banging around inside the watch face.  Then lastly, the watch keeps dying on me.  I changed the battery with new fresh batteries 3 times already, and it dies on me all the time.  I take off my watch at night, wake up the next day before going to work, and see that the watch stopped around 2am the night before.  I have to adjust the time, then go to work.  Then, sometime during the day it'll stop.  I look at my watch and I think it's 3:15pm-- what a long work day...  And realize it's actually 7pm!!  Even a $10 children's watch keeps better time than this...Seeing how the warranty is up, there is nothing I can do about it.  So I'm actually shopping for the exact same watch and came to Amazon.  This is a good price, I paid $100+tax at my local Nordstrom.  But I am asking myself, buy another $100 watch (or $70 at Amazon) that will last 1 year, or spend some good money $500+ for a watch that might last me at least 5 years??  Hmmm...  Titanium watch selections are limited, though.  Especially in the style I want-- traditional, no chrono, clean face with a traditional clasp style.  Like this 105LTX watch.  But higher quality...  I am still shopping around, but I think I'm not going to buy this again.",1

"Why I bought this watch:I have worn Casio digital watches for the past 20 years and have loved the multi-function features and the durability of the watches themselves.  My other Casio watches have all had 12/24 hour time keeping, dual timezone time keeping, programmable day/month/year alarm, split lap stopwatch, countdown timer, and the ability to be submerged in water up to 50 meters deep.  The reason I keep buying new watches is that the bomb-proof watches come with these cheesy plastic bands that break way too easily.""Wouldn't it be nice if this watch came with a metal band?"" I thought to myself.""Oila!--the A158W-1"" I thought to myself.  I read the product description and the reviews here on Amazon and didn't find anything about the countdown timer, which is one of the features of my previous Casio watches that I used most often.  A wider web search of reviews yielded some people talking about how great all the features are--including the countdown timer.  So, I was really excited.The features the watch has...  and doesn't have:This watch DOES have *  12/24 hour time keeping *  time, day, and date display *  light for viewing the display in the dark *  daily alarm *  split lap stopwatch *  water resistance for situations like getting caught in the rainThis watch DOES NOT have *  countdown timer *  dual timezone time keeping *  monthly and yearly alarm *  water resistance for situations like washing the car or swimmingWhy I am disappointed with this watch:So many of the same features I have come to rely on daily or almost daily are not available with this watch--1) I do a lot of stuff in the kitchen that requires a timer, and I was able to just set the countdown alarm on my trusty Casio watch (but not this one)2) I work with people in different time zones, and I travel a lot, and I was able to just set the dual timezone time keepers on my trusty Casio watch (but not this one)3) I would often need to remind myself of something I needed to do at a certain time later in the week, and so I could just set my monthly or yearly alarm to go off on at a specific time on a specific day on my trusty Casio watch (but not this one)4) I tend to put stuff down and forget where I put it.  With a waterproof watch I could take a shower, wash the dishes, go swimming, etc, and not worry about destroying my trusty Casio watch (but not this one).  When the instructions say not to wear it while washing the car or while swimming, one assumes it's not OK to wear it in the shower either, where one usually gets wetter than when one washes the car.Other stuff I'm not happy about:The metal band is pretty cheesy, which other reviewers here have commented on as well so I expected it--but it is *really* cheesy.Also, I'm a pretty average-sized woman, with a wrist diameter of about 5.75"", and the band does not flex sufficiently for the watch to sit comfortably on my wrist.  The band is very stiff which positions the watch awkwardly and makes it feel quite bulky and uncomfortable to wear.So would I buy this watch again?  NO.  Would I recommend it to anyone else?  NO.  Not at this price or any other.",1
I bought the Dockers Men's Perspective because I had a pair of the same shoe a couple years back that was a very comfortable shoe that last several years of me going to work.  When I was getting rid of my old pair I went and bought the same pair of shoes.  Dockers must have change something in how they make the shoe because I bought these in April and now the seams are noticeably fraying and one of my shoes the seams on the inside of the foot has completely ripped.  These shoes do fit and are comfortable but as they have not even made it through 1 year of use for me I would not recommend these shoes.Update - 6-19-2017  The shoes I bought last year had a seam on the inside of the foot lower piece of leather.  Unfortunately the product description on this site shows that seam does not exist in the pictures.  I ordered the shoes again hoping the Amazon site was correct with the pictures but it is not.  So it seems as though Dockers had added a seam to an inside strip of leather which the Amazon product description does not include.  I will be returning this product and I highly recommend not buying this product.,1

I got three pairs of these: one tan pair and two black pairs. The tan pair I wore twice and the second day I noticed two large holes where the normal nylon legs attach to the crotch area. Needless to say I was disappointed. The very next day I wore a pair of the black ones and when I got to work in the morning realized there was already a couple picks that turned into runs as the day went on. These are a rip-off.

I ordered a deluxe Quidditch robe elsewhere and was convinced I had been sent the economy version. It was made of thin cheap looking fake 'crushed velvet' polyester. I had a heated discussion with a sales assistant who assured me it was the deluxe version despite the fact it looked nothing like the photograph on the packet which looked like a heavy fleece fabric. It carried a Rubie's Costumes label. I returned it and shopped elsewhere hoping for better. This one is slightly better but still looks cheap and is made of thin velvet polyester. This too carries a Rubie's label and is supposed to be deluxe. Have all the felt ones been sold and poorer quality robes been substituted ? It is also rather short and has a badly printed smudged 7 on the back too.I dearly want a felt one for my daughter for Halloween.Any suggestions anyone ?,0

"This was my third timex watch that was destroyed by water. The product description said it had 100 meters of water on it. I put it on the side of the pool when it's raining, and it's almost completely unusable. My next watch will not be a timex!",1
"[...]Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association, ""Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots. The dictionary definition of an 'ugg boot' is 'a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside'. An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin. Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin, one of the first warning bells will be a so called 'ugg boot' advertised at a very cheap price. ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes, absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics. (Most synthetics become very smelly with wear).""[25]Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth, Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China, Aussie Sheep and Wool Products, best in durability; Deckers Ugg boots, which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested, were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers.[26] The Emu Ridge, Skiniks and Mortels brands ""fared badly for quality"".[26][edit] DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached. The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside. Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole, commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate (or EVA)[citation needed] and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot. The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots: the thick fleecy fibers on the inner part of the boots wick moisture and allow air to circulate, keeping the feet at body temperature.[27] This property allows Ugg boots to keep feet warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather.[28] The original design was a pull-on boot in natural (undyed) tan sheepskin, about 10 inches (25 cm) in height, with rounded, almost shapeless uppers; this is now described as the ""classic"" design. Produced by a number of manufacturers, they come in a variety of colours, including black, pink, blue, chestnut, and fuchsia.[29] They are available in both pull-on and lace-up varieties and their height can range from just above the ankle to above the knee.[29]Some variations of ugg style boots have also been made from kangaroo fur and leather.[30] There are also synthetic boots. Although derided as ""fake"" by some in the industry,[25] their lower price made them appealing to large retail chains such as Myer.[31]In 2009 American podiatrist Ed Chairman raised concern that the regular wearing of ugg boots could be deleterious to foot health due to the lack of arch support.[32][edit] Trademark disputesThe UGG trademark has been the subject of dispute in several countries. The trademark for ""Ugh-Boots"" has been removed from the trademark registry in Australia for non-use.[3] Outside Australia and New Zealand, UGG (written in capital letters) is a registered trademark of Deckers Outdoor Corporation.[22]In 1971, an Australian surfer, Shane Steadman, registered the name ""UGH-BOOTS"" as a trademark in Australia and began selling sheepskin boots under that name. In 1982 he registered the name ""UGH"" and a logo containing a stylised Sun with the words ""UGG AUSTRALIA"".[4] In 1979, Brian Smith, another Australian surfer, brought several pairs of Australian-made boots to the US and began selling them in New York and to surfers in California.[28] He set up Ugg Holdings Inc. and in 1996 purchased the trademarks from Steadman. In 1996 he sold his interest to Deckers and in 1999 Deckers registered the trademarks for ""UGG"" in the US.[4][33]In 1999, Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent out cease and desist letters to Australian manufacturers.[3] In the early 2000s, demand for ugg boots was soaring, partly as a result of US$8 million spent on marketing by Deckers, but also due to several celebrity endorsements.[3] Australian and USA based manufacturers began selling uggs over the Internet, and Deckers' law firm Middletons of Melbourne began a serious effort to halt the Australian companies' sales.[3] In 2004, Deckers sent cease and desist letters to a number of Australian and USA based manufacturers, including Mortels Sheepskin Factory, preventing them from selling uggs on eBay or from using the word in domain names.[34]In response to these actions by Deckers, some Australian manufacturers formed the Australian Sheepskin Association to fight the corporation's claim, arguing that ""ugg"" is a generic term referring to flat-heeled, pull-on sheepskin boots. They further argued that Australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades, including exporting them to the US. One of these manufacturers, Perth's Uggs-N-Rugs, appealed to Australian trademark regulators.[3] The officer who heard the case stated that the ""evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms (ugg, ugh and ug boots) are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods."" In 2006 Uggs-N-Rugs won the right to use the term UGG BOOT/S and variations such as UGH UGG BOOT/S. IP Australia also ruled that the trademark ""Ugh-boots"" should be removed from the trademark register for non-use as Deckers had only been using the UGG logo, not the UGH marks.[4][3] Deckers retained the rights to their UGG logo as trade mark protection only applies for the way the mark appears in its entirety and not for the words it contains. To date Deckers have declined to pay Uggs-N-Rugs legal costs as required by the ruling.[5] The 2006 ruling only applies in Australia and Deckers still owns the trademarks in all other jurisdictions, including the US, China, Japan and the European Union.[3]In 2005, the validity of the UGG trademark was challenged in federal court in California; the court ruled for Deckers, stating that consumers in the US consider UGG to be a brand name.[22] In his final order, the judge stated that the defendants had provided anecdotal evidence of the term's generic usage, but Deckers countered through submitting declarations from four professionals in the footwear industry who stated that ""UGG"" is widely recognized in the industry as a brand name, not a generic term.[22] Deckers also petitioned the Oxford English Dictionary to change the definition of ""ugg"" from ""a kind of soft sheepskin boot"" to a definition that included UGG's trademark.[35][edit]",0

"I own several pair of Levi's 590s and they have all lasted a super long time. One pair was finally starting to get worn so I bought another. I have to say, I am not very happy with this new pair. The quality has gone WAY down. These are very thin compared even with my oldest, most worn pair. What I loved about this brand has gone away. May as well spend a quarter of the price and get crappy Old Navy jeans. The rise on these is also higher and the leg longer than my identical sized ones bought previously. The 99% cotton, 1% elastin mix is still there, but the material feels different, probably due to the thinness. I am glad to see that the fake butt flap pockets are gone. 3 stars for now, I'll update as these wear and see how quickly they need to be replaced. **update** It's been about a month since my last review and I am still super unhappy with these.

"Yes, these are Cole Haan's. Yes, they're the Pinch Penny (non-Nike Air). Yes, they're a good price. However, this pair is a step down from the identical shoe I have owned maybe a dozen pairs of over the past 25 years.First, I have always loved these shoes. The Pinch series were absolutely made for my feet. Classic styling, durable Brush-Off leather uppers, cushioned leather lining, great fit and superb comfort, unlike most Johnston Murphy's I have tried.I've long been dubious of CH's move to Indian manufacturing of the Pinch series, and this pair confirmed why. The US-made shoe (gone for about 15 years) was of quality non-par. The Mexican-made products that followed were nearly as good. However, now they come from India, and the shoe sucks!This is the first CH shoe I have owned that does not have a combination leather/rubber heel. These have a full rubber heel, with an affectatious grove molded into it where the leather to rubber joint used to be. Not that it really matters to most people, except die-hard Cole Haan buyers like me. The all rubber heel adds nothing to its durability, and the fake groove actually makes the shoe look like a cheap knock-off.Beyond that, the previous meticulous moc-toe stitching now is bunched and slightly uneven, and the lower portion of the toe box appears to have been stitched to the sole in a twisted manner. The leather soles on this pair were cracked and wrinkled at the leading edge of the heel, giving them an extremely cheap appearance.These are not your father's Pinch Penny. They are simply mediochre examples of the attention to detail that we have come to expect of Cole Haan shoes. I promptly returned mine and will shop locally for a pair that is a better example of the company's former level of workmanship.NOTE  -If you don't find this review helpful, please leave a comment and tell me why. If for some reason you simply don't like it, I challenge you to write a better one.",0

"Like another reviewer, if I could give this zero stars, I would.  It is terrible - and not in an awesome Halloween kind of terrible.  The material is so thin, it's almost ""cheesecloth"" (white sweats must be worn underneath it).  The front only has three 1"" size squares of velcro as its fasteners, so it does not stay closed.  Unlike the product description, the arms are NOT free to move... once you tie the ends of the sleeves (in the back, behind your back), you're stuck that way until someone unties you.  And both pieces ripped after the first hour of wear - pants at the crotch & both sleeves under the armpits.  Please don't waste your money on this!  You'd be better off buying a pair of long-sleeve white nurses scrubs.",1

"I have to preface this review by saying that my rating is based on a standard. I purchased this exact belt 12 years ago in 2006. I have worn that belt nearly every day or every other day since, implying that I conservatively have worn this belt for 2,190 10-14 hour days. That belt is in relatively good shape still. Additionally, the leather is still quite beautiful. I've worn it in torrential downpours, at paint parties, etc. This belt has literally seen it all. It is also probably one of the oldest garments that I still wear to this day.With all of that being said, when I decided that I wanted to order another one to keep in case the older one was destroyed or worn away somehow, and received the belt that came from Amazon, I was flabbergasted. The new version of this belt is HORRID. I purchased a black leather Tommy Hilfiger belt two years ago, and was disappointed in the quality... I figured I just bought a belt that they had outsourced the manufacturing to some crap shop to sell in Macy's. The 2018 brown belt has the exact same vinyl-feeling surface as the black belt has. I've attached a bunch of photos comparing the new and old brown belts, as well as the black belt, with two years of wear (and this one I wore maybe 1-3 days a week for the past two years (208ish 10-14 hour days of wear)). You can see that the newer ones have this fake vinyl stuff covering the fronts (if you take the belt and bend it the opposite way you'd bend it if it were being wrapped around one's waist, you can see the surface material bunch up. Genuine leather does not allow air to accumulate under such a thin layer and bunch up that layer. There is indeed genuine leather on the backside of the belt, but it's bonded to this fabric inner-core which is covered with this fake vinyl stuff. I guess that means the manufacturers can call it ""genuine leather"". They should have to specify what % of genuine leather the ""leather"" parts of the product are.Basically, two out of two tommy hilfiger belts I have purchased in the past two years have not been genuine leather as I've come to expect from their 12 year old product. I'm done shopping the brand. :( RIPEveryone's gotta lower prices while maintaining margins, and I understand that. I just have a very hard time when a product goes from a higher quality manufacturing process/material down to one that is an entirely different category.",0

I was very disappointed that someone didn't check the boots more closely before shipping, especially since it was so close to Christmas and more than likely they knew it was a Christmas gift. It tied up a $114 of my money and I had to find another gift and wait on my money from the boots. I understand that things can be damaged, but especially during Christmas, shippers should check things before shipping.",0

"This bra....I just...I don't even know where to start. It's absolutely horrible. So bad I didn't even try it on all the way. First of all, I could barely clasp it even though I ordered the size I normally get and that size fits me well. Secondly, it feels like it's made of steel wool, so if you can construct something supportive out of steel wool, you'd be in the same boat. Thirdly, if you like how the 1950's cone boobs looked, this is the bra for you. I accidentally ordered a cup size too small and it was still too big for me somehow. Don't waste your time with this scratchy, cone boob bra because you'll have to take the time to return it when you could be watching Netflix instead.",1

"The first time I ordered this bag, it arrived stained and almost seemed like it had been used. I figured it was a one off mistake and arranged for an exchange. The second backpack was clean and new- however the front 'reflective' logo looks completely different to the original bag I received. It's kind of shimmery and less clear than the one on the first bag I received, and doesn't actually 'reflect' like it's supposed to. The bag also has a different set of tags attached to the original. This all set me off reading about fake Kankens. I'm pretty sure the second bag I received is not an authentic Kanken.Wouldn't recommend trying to buy an authentic Kanken off amazon unless you're okay with stained items or unexplained inconsistencies across products.Note: The stains on the first bag I received are pictured, along with the two bags side by side (dirty bag pictured on right hand side, dodgy bag pictured on left hand side)",0
"We bought  his regular size and another in a size up to try on, as many review indicated the shoes ran small. My son said the larger pair felt better than the size he normally wears. They were comfortable, felt good and ""cushiony"" and did not slip when he walked. After he had tried them on, I took them to the sink to test the M Dry waterproofing. I ran a small stream of water for about 2 seconds, just to wet one section of the mesh on the outside of the shoe. Sure enough, the finger I was hold on the inside of that section got wet. Please be aware that, although the product description states these are M Dry, THEY ARE NOT M DRY and ARE NOT WATERPROOF. After further research, I have found other Merrells that are M Dry, and they will have a small tag on the outside of the shoe that says M Dry. These do not have that tag.We considered keeping them anyway, as my son loved the look and feel. But, as we boxed them back up anticipating their possible return, one of the black elastic laces broke - just popped right out of the eyelet. I can imagine they wouldn't last long with a 9 year old boy running and playing in them regularly. So, they will remain boxed back up for their return to Amazon.",1

"I bought these ""mid weight base layers"" for a backpacking trip in upstate NY and was extremely disappointed with the product. When they first arrived, I was slightly causcious that they felt quite thin to be base layers but read the product description on the container it came in and it insisted that it was one of their warmest products. However, this proved not to be true as I was absolutely freezing for my entire trip. Even when the weather didn't reach below 60 and I had layers on top, I would still be absolutely miserable from being so cold. What's worse is that after wearing them once, they stretched out so much to the point where they wouldn't even stay up and I was constantly having to pull them up, which was especially tricky as I was carrying a 50lb pack all day long. Very dissapointed, especially for the price I paid for these...",1

"I bought this scale hoping to weigh various items, some of which are less than 50 g. Nowhere on this page is there any mention that the minimum weight for this scale is 100 g (that's what the instruction book has, but you don't see that until after you've received the scale).However, I was having real difficulty getting any sort of reading for my items so I contacted the manufacturer via their website ([...]) and got this reply stating:""The reason why it is not displaying anything is because of the amount of weight that you are measuring. This scale will go up to 49 kilograms and will read out in increments of 20 grams, however the minimum weight requirement for this scale is 200 grams. Anything under this weight will not display due to the internal processing of the scale. Also there is a tolerance range that is inherent for all scales, this range is usually twice the minimum increments that the scale reads out in. For this scale the tolerance is 40 grams meaning that if you weighed an object it could show as plus or minus 40 grams and still be operating within it limits.""He then suggested I purchase a mechanical scale with an optional weighing pan.So I'm giving this review 1 star because the scale was unsuitable for me. While perhaps some of that is my fault in expecting it to weigh my items, the lack of a minimum weight in the product description and facts is misleading as is the tolerance range of 40 g when the increments are 20 g.Because of postage, I ended up paying well over $30 for this scale and it's useless to me.

"What a disappointment. This item is clearly fake and does not resemble the photo what so ever. It is nothing more than a poorly printed, crooked logo on a paper thin t shirt. There wasn't a single ""DC"" tag on the shirt. Save yourself some time and purchase from a different seller. This is my second knock off shirt that has arrived from a different seller (both sent from a china address). Surprisingly, both shirts were made exactly the same (same color logo and generic no brand tag) which means that the seller has several accounts. I will be reporting this seller as well. Hope this helps.",0

"I bought this Santa suit for a Christmas Party with a bunch of little kids that are already skeptical of him....when I received the item, the packaging was very beat up, and the costume was NOT what they showed online.I ordered the largest size they had, because a full grown man was planning on wearing it, and the only things that fit were the jacket and belt.  The boot toppers barely fit around my calves, and I weigh 120 pounds.  The wig and beard were completely fake looking - you could see the mesh through the hair -  not to mention, the wig was SO small that it would never fit an adult.  The hat was also too small for the head of a normal sized adult.  The pants were more like capris, and the material that the whole suit was made out of was basically thin felt.I have always been pleased with all of my Amazon purchases up until now, and now I don't have a Santa suit for the Christmas party, because 7th Avenue Costumes sent me a sub-standard, overpriced Santa suit.  I called customer service to ask for a full refund and told them how unhappy I was, and they are making me pay for shipping both ways AND a restocking fee.  I am very disappointed with their customer service, and I will never buy a costume from them again.",0

Beyond that the item was as described and the picture is an accurate reflection of they're appearance.

It is hollow on the back side and so you get just half a heart. It is not a full three dimensional item. If you cut two eye holes in it, you could turn it into a Halloween mask.  I don't know of a better product for a better price, which moved me from one star to two. With more time, I would have made a heart for my costume.",1

"As far as the costume itself, it was fine and what you would expect.  But for size, ""standard"" must mean 5'8"" and below.  I'm not that big, 6' tall and thin...but since the costume is a one piece jumpsuit style...when i tried to pull it over my shoulders it was way too tight in the crotch area.  That's all the details i'll say on that.  I thought of reordering and despite seeing a size chart, i didn't see any way to select the size i wanted.  (maybe i missed that option).  I basically cut the costume in half and modified it myself.  it worked for this yr, but that will probably be it.  The one downfall of ordering on-line...sizes.  Better luck to you.By comparison...the scarecrow costume i ordered at the same time also said 'one size fits most' actually fit me (but my wife used it).",1

"This was the worst quality costume I have ever seen! I have 6 children so I have dealt with many over the years. The foam hat won't stay on my daughters head and was bent during shipping. The thin, cheap costume was ripped 3 1/2 inches in the crotch area with sideways runs that I am unable to sew. Not to mention it is so cheaply made it hardly looks like Jessie. We ordered a 4T, my daughter usually wears a 4T-5T, this costume was huge on her. The crotch area hangs down almost to her knees. This is odd bc shes very tall for her age and another parent's review says it was way too small for their child. The hat, however, is so small in comparison to the clothing part. I tried to return it through Amazon and due to it being through another seller they can not exchange it, just a cash refund. Unfortuantly, I cut the credit card so I am now stuck with this horrible costume! They will not let me exchange it for another of equal value or even for the same one. The worst part is when my daughter opened the package she was beside herself with excitement untill we found the rip and the bent hat that won't stay on her head. Needless to say, my little girl cried bc she has ""a ruined costume"" and ""she doesnt look like Jessie"". ",1
The advertised description and my receipt clearly state that this is supposed to be a Pack of 6.  There are two pair in the box.  Next time I'll go to Penney's or Wal Mart and get what I pay for.,1
These are fake vans. DO NOT BUY THEM. The stitching and the soles of the shoes are off. They are counterfeit vans,0
Make annoying squeaking noises with every step I take. Two weeks of wearing them and I still cant break them in enough to get the noise to stop.,1
This belt lasted 4 months and is now falling apart. The layers have come unglued and the belt is now 3 straps of fake leather dangling. Absolute worst belt craftsmanship I have ever seen. Would not recommend this belt to anyone,0

These are fake Sperrys and not worth the money.  The shoe is very flimsy and falls apart. The seller using false advertising to sell the product.  If you look in the fine details you will see that they are not real Sperry's.  Wish I would have known that before I purchased.,0
The bra is pretty but I just cant wear underwires. They won't take product back as it is a undergarment...wish I would have known that before I spent money on it!,0
Got this from What is Hot seller. Fake UGG!  No authenticity label sewn on the boots.  The bar code on the box is fake!  The leather on the side of boot are two pieces not one piece as shown in the picture!,0

"I read all the other reviews and made sure that I would only be buying from Amazon directly and I thought that Amazon wouldn't be selling FAKE Ray Ban made in china when clearly it state in the description that it was made in Italy. To my surprise and disappointment my Ray Ban arrived and on the arm it state that it was made in China. Though a very good copy but when I compared it to the same Ray Ban that I had, you could see clearly the difference in quality and the feel in the material used as well.It you don't have one to compare it too then you might not know the difference but even at half the price if still a cheaper imitation. You might as well buy from the street vendor selling knock offs sunnies. Waste of time and effort in returning the sunglasses.Now I know better as Amazon has lost my trust because if they start selling fake then they has just become like an Ebay.",0
"I have worn this brand and style for many years. I am sad to report that I've noticed that a pair from this order that I have worn twice has broken down in places and has two holes. Yes, I am in the correct size. It seems that the fabric quality is not how it used to be",1

"The fit is fine, but I do not believe this garment is made by Dockers. The fabric is inferior and has a ""worn"" feeling to it, as though someone else had worn the pants and washed them several times.While the labels have the Dockers logo, the buttons are not the same as those found on U-S store-bought Dockers.In short, I believe these are fake and an infringement on the design and manufacture of Dockers brand clothing.",0
"I don't know if these were fake, or if they were just 2nd's or 3rd's. Felt very light in my hand......but they fit good.Then I went to clean the lenses......and they both moved around when I rubbed them. That shouldn't even happen with a $10 pair of shades. Nuff said!",0

"I purchased these Toms against my better judgment, since they were listed as $14 less than the same shoes at Toms.com. I own several other pairs of Toms and I knew once I opened the box that these shoes were too large. Though they were listed as a women's size 8 on the inside of the shoe, they fit more like a 9.5. There was a good inch of free space in the end of my shoe. Actual Toms do not fit like this. Suspicion aroused, I googled how to tell real Toms from fake Toms and discovered that these shoes fit all the warning signs-- the first of which is that they are not true to Toms sizes (which are extremely true to size). The second warning sign was that the leather bottoms in these shoes easily can be pulled up (they are stitched down in real Toms.) In the case of the pair I ordered, the leather part would bunch under my foot, only to be straightened out again on each down step- extremely annoying. The last warning sign was shoddy stitching. These had many uneven stitches, where it looked like the shoe was turned suddenly under the sewing machine, causing angles where there should be straight lines. There were also areas where the stitching was coming out already and could be pulled out farther. So, though these appear to be Toms (same logos, styling, materials, etc), they are NOT. Save yourself the hassle and just buy them from Toms.com and pay the extra money. You'll be glad you did - REAL Toms last forever and are extremely comfortable.",0

"Based on Amazon and other reviews, these UGG boots were supposed to be comfortable, very warm and waterproof. My size is 8 or 8.5.

I put the boots on to feel how warm they are and I noticed that my feet (especially the toes) were NOT warm at all in 68 F apartment.  I was very disappointed and tried to find out if other customers had the same or similar problem. After reading more about these boots and problems with them, I realized that  the UGG boots I had received were MOST probably NOT authentic.

The second problem I have is that it's from Belle Hop, while yes this is a sub-company of Lewis N. Clark but it is aimed specifically at women. From the product description I would have never guessed this. After going to the Lewis N. Clark website and not finding the product I ordered, I was able to find it on Belle Hop, however from what I see on their website they don't even sell it anymore.

"I believe these are also fake Toms albeit really good fakes. I did bring this to the attention of the seller and he was offended and insisted that he bought them directly from Toms but there are clear differences between the Toms we purchased from Nordstrom (authorized seller of Toms) and the Toms we bought from Amazon. I'm attaching photos of the two shoes so you can see the side-by-side comparison. The really telling sign of fake Toms is that the insole comes right out of the Amazon Toms (barely glued in place) whereas the Nordstrom Toms have an insole that's firmly sewn into place. Additionally, the Amazon Toms have no arch support (that area is basically flat), whereas the Nordstrom Toms do have arch support. The canvas color is slightly different, the thread is slightly different, the shoes are slightly different heights and the Toms tag on the back of the shoe is slightly off-centered on the Amazon Toms. Finally the paper tags are slightly different as well. So you can decide for yourself if these are fake or not. I sent them back and kept the Nordstrom ones which were only about $7 more anyway.",0

"My two-star rating is because:1. The product states that it is made of leather.  It is not.  It feels and looks very much NOT like leather.2. The product description on this site states that it has genuine shearling.  I'm afraid not.  Polyester, all the way.3. The sizing is off; the boot is narrow, yet pulls up in the heel loosely when walking. (perhaps they stretch, but still waiting to see)If you're comfortable paying $130 for a cute, non-leather, non shearling boot- then go for it... But just know that what they're selling you is NOT what you get.They're cute and warm, sure, but at least  SAY what you're selling Amazon... come on now!",1
"this is a complete waste of money,charged to much for shipping box was crushed a bit but that's delivery driver fault.",0
Size too small and the shoe is lined with fake fur.. making it even smaller and worthless in a warm climate,0
Dont waste your money. It looks like it would be a good accessory for your costume but its just a light weight piece of plastic you safety pin to your costume. I could of homemade one that looked more convincing.,1
shoes to big to wear,1
"They are fricking huge!!! Theres enough extra material in the seat, crotch and thigh sections of these pants. Its possible you just take flight in a strong wind. I've always avioded  ""relax fit"" jeans, because  they've always felt/looked baggie on a average body shape, such as mine. But the cut of these jeans take it to all new level of stupid. Especially for a pair of jeans that DOESN'T include ""Relax cut"" in the product description",1
"I liked the color, but the reinforced toe was way too large.  Even though my shoes were not cut that low, the dark area still showed.",1
"Usually I love Teva's brand, but this one was defective I suppose. I could not put my right foot in it. It was too tight. The left foot was okay. I will still buy Teva but from the Teva website. Not sure if this is a fake Teva brand, but it was nowhere near the quality of my other Teva sandal I bought at the Portland airport.",0
"I have been a faithful Teva wearer for over 15 years.  As I have worn out my last two pairs, I decided to try this new style.  It looks good; but it did not wear good.  For the last 6 years I have been working in the Middle East so my main purchasing outlet is Amazon.com.  I was going to Thailand with my daughter and decided to try this pair.  At the end of the first day of moderte walking I was just about crippled.  What you cannot see from the Amazon provided picture is under the front toe strap from the inside of the sole is a flap of material that is a continuation of the harness.  This flapped literally worn the skin off of the top of my second & third toes.  The product description says ""Classic"" teva strapping, but this is unlike any other design I have seen from them.  Usually they have a triangle that connect the side support and the the toe strap goes thru and folds back onto itselt and velcos in place.  I have no idea what Teva was thinking about when they deviated from their classic design for this foot killer design.If you decide to try these I recommend trying them on at a store first and see if they will work for you and not buy them on the internet.  After payng $100 for a pair of sandals, the last thing you want is to take the change of bad shoes. I did give the sandals two stars because once I wore socks (Fashion Faux Pas) my toes healed up and they were fine.  After a couple days of this I finally broke down and bought some flip flops._",1
My daughter has the same pair from 3 years ago.  These came way too small and not in a Frye box.  I think they were fake. Nothing like the quality of her first pair.  Very unhappy and sent back for refund.,0
My son wore these for less than a minute before they broke. They have straps that you wear around your arms and they easily detach from the wings.,1
"Watch out, these are very clever fakes. They got me, don't let them get you too. If you go ahead and buy them anyways. Flick an authentic pair of Ray-Ban lens with your fingernail and listen to the sound. Then flick these lens and listen. You'll notice a distinct difference. I have 5 pairs of Ray-Bans I bought from ray-ban.com and they all have the same sound. The 2 pairs I bought from Hong Kong sound the same as each other, but different than the other 5 pairs I have. It's because they use a low quality lens and the color wears off. Please don't buy and support scammers.",0
I gave one star just for delivery. The shoes are defective. And I am not sure it is leather.  I am very disappointed. Send it back.,0

The bag isn't *quite* as big as our older x-small which theyve quit makingwe have oneand which has one large velcro-fastened flap pocket where this one has two smaller mag-snap ones (neither of which will hold an iPhone 6 Plus). The same day I received it, I filed for a return. (I won't go into the problems UPS has had handling the returnsevere, off topic, and I hope it doesn't hinder my pricey refund.) Maybe you'll like this bag: it fits a certain niche: just not mine.",1
too bad ... I wish I could give it 0 stars ... the material is very rough on the skin ... I don't use it at all ... such a waste of money!!!,1
I'm pretty sure these are fakes. The soles feel like cardboard and I'm not sure what these boots are made of but it's not leather. There is not a dr.marten brand stamp on the side like the picture displays. Basically these look and feel like cheap China crap. I was so excited for these to arrive now I'm bummed and mad that I have to return these.,0
Had to return the shorts.  I wear the same size in the same pants.  Way too small.,1
"Product description:  85% wool, 15% nylon. No mention of elastic.  Feet are cold.  Searched HOURS for good quality non-binding warm wool socks, read all reviews, ordered these.  When they arrived, I saw the packaging says ""strategically placed elastic to create grip.""  I wear womens size 9.5 shoes.  These socks are for size 8-12 men.  They're knee-highs, and I couldn't pull them any higher than crew socks would be.  WAY too narrow for the legs, and there is little give in the leg part due to all the WAY TOO MUCH ELASTIC that the web product description didn't mention.  The part that goes over the feet, however, would easily fit a man's size 12 foot. Totally disappointed, sending them back.",1
Pretty awful; Bad decision. It's so cheaply made! It was falling apart as soon as I opened the box. And there is hardly any straw on it for the broom! I ended up buying a stick and straw at Michael's and making my own.,1
"Item arrived sealed in original packaging with no damage.  Upon opening the item itself contained no less then 10 different factory defects that were obviously visible to the exterior and interior of the cabinet.  manufacturing scratches to wood were stained and sealed over and cut cross grain.  Interior velvet not seamed properly, edges show, uneven, and a chunk missing.  Exterior drawers (3) contain pit holes in the wood and are plainly visible.  Ring dividers, one row is half the height of the other 4 rows adjacent-again this isn't damage but cut disproportionately and slapped in.  Very disappointed with the quality of the specific item received.Picture of item looks great & overall design a good idea, BUT the one received wouldn't even make a factory 2nd rating--FACTORY REJECT that they stained and hoped no one would notice.Have contacted the factory per the enclosed Parts and Damage Replacement Procedure - have to see if they stand behind their product.  At this point, wouldn't spend the money, and now there is no gift to surprise my spouse with the birthday.Contacted manufacturer--their reply was that the item was 'antiqued' and that various techniques are used to create a distressed and antiqued product, and that the pit holes in the drawers were intentional.  Unfortunately, no where in the product description was it mentioned that the product was ""Antiqued or Distressed.""  This was the one and only response from the manufacturer.  Would not purchase from this company (Powell) again, based on the attitude and lack of responsiveness to the product damage which was illustrated in photos to the company.",1

"One shoe is higher than the other, and makes you walk with a limp. Really a sub standard product that should be banned from Amazon. Don't waste your money on these folks. I am not returning them as I have worn them and I will keep them to use when I am a taking out the trash or working in my garden. That way I can at least have the pleasure of destroying these worthless shoes. They are really awful and useless with the exception of standing in mud, oil, dirt, mud and pouring paint on them!",1
The size of the broom is small but wasn't the problem for me really.  IIt the quality.  I'm going to have to really beef up the bristles if I want to use this.,1

"Oddly enough, I've ordered these three times.  The first time, I was delighted with the sunglasses I received (~April 2015); it was the first time in my life I bought a pair of sunglasses that didn't come from a rotating display in a drug store.  The quality was outstanding, and I could wear them all day long without discomfort.  Alas, I waded into the ocean while wearing my beloved sunglasses, and a freak wave knocked me to the ocean floor, losing my glasses forever.I re-ordered the exact same pair from Amazon.  Immediately I could tell something was amiss: instead of the black matte finish, these were shiny plastic.  They also crinkled if your torqued them in the slightest, as though the seems between the lens and the frame didn't fit properly.  The hinges of the arms were stiff and squeaked.  Worst of all, they pinched my temples fiercely, and couldn't be worn for more than 20 minutes consecutively.  They weren't obvious fakes, but the low quality and worrisome details led me to complain and request a replacement pair.Happily, Amazon complied, and with some trepidation I opened the replacement package two days later, and the new new sunglasses matched the first pair.  So, there's a happy ending.  Still, very worrisome that you can order the exact same product three times and get such dramatically different qualities.  I don't know if this is Amazon's problem or Ray Ban's, but in any case, I'd read up on how to spot Ray Ban fakes before you commit to whatever Amazon ships you.",0

"I debated about buying this costume in the 3T-4T size because my son is at the very end of 2T clothing.  A review said it ran small so I bought it and they were definitely right.  My son fits this costume perfectly.  He has loved it since he first set eyes on it and wears it every opportunity he gets.  I was under the impression my son is unable to dress himself, but every time I turn around I find him in this costume, which he got into completely unassisted.  Determination and excitement may play a roll in that since I have yet to see him dress himself in normal clothes...It's a great weight and durability for a halloween costume.  The belt isn't sewn together very well, but it will be usable for a while.  The cape is a great weight - not too heavy where it tugs at my son's neck and I love that the bottoms of the legs have extra material that will cover regular shoes so he can wear his normal shoes but still look like superman from head to toe.An excellent costume for occasional use, wouldn't use it every day for an extended time, but I would definitely buy it as a Halloween costume again.***UPDATE PLEASE READ!***UPDATE:  Less than 2 hours after putting this costume on (and with no unusual activity) the seams all along the backside have torn completely and there are runs up and down the back.  My son is not too big for this costume (36"" tall and 32 lbs), but it is NOT durable.  We went to one trick or treating event and when that was over, his costume was ruined.  He won't even be able to wear it during the normal trick or treat hours to help hand out candy.  VERY disappointed with the durability of this costume.  Would NOT buy again.",1

"I purchased these Uggs on Amazon instead of the Ugg Australia website so I would get them in 2 days. I figured that since I was buying them for full price I wasn't purchasing knock-offs.What I received were knock-offs of exceptionally low quality.I returned them and purchased directly from Ugg Australia's website. Attached are comparison photos I took of the fake product I purchased here and then the authentic pair I purchased from Ugg Australia.Comparison #1: You'll notice the difference between the texture of the wool in the authentic and this fake product. The shape of the authentic Ugg is more svelte while this fake product is tube-like and ugly.Comparison #2: Again the difference between the texture of the wool is obvious.Comparison #3: The outer lining and wool inner lining of this fake product is so cheap and thin that when you pinch the toe of the shoe on either side of the center seam, the material indents and stays indented. When you pinch authentic Uggs in the same way, you can't make the material indent no matter how much you try.Comparison #4: The toe and heel of the sole of authentic Uggs are tilted up slightly and when sitting on a flat surface, they do not contact the surface. The sole of this fake product is completely flat. When this fake product is sitting on a flat surface, the entire sole is in contact with that surface. You can also see the difference in the color and texture of the wool lining in this comparison.Comparison #5: The biggest giveaway that this fake product is fake is the Ugg ""stamp"" on the top of the shoe. This fake product is stamped simply ""UGG"" and the letters are colored in. Authentic Uggs are stamped ""UGG australia"" and the letters are not filled in. And again in this photo you can see the difference in the color and texture of the wool.Furthermore, authentic Uggs will have a QR code label sewn into the left shoe and a match QR code sticker on the outside of the shoebox. This fake product came with a fake QR code label in the left shoe and no QR code sticker on the shoebox.This fake product is tight and authentic Uggs run large, not small.These are 100% FAKE. Don't waste your time.",0

The 505s I got came tag saying 'sits waist ' , NOT used say .Before , 505s zipper fly version 501s .Putting pair 505s I already owned next new pair Amazon , I could see crotch waist almost inch shorter new pair .Trying new pair , I discovered unpleasant sensation 'man part ' crushed agonizing way .No amount tugging would get pant sit right.Then I tried 515 slim jean , actually ROOMIER crotch area .The thigh little slimmer 505s , seat main difference .No sag seat 515s compared 505.And trying recently purchased 515s ( color new 505s I purchased ) I noticed something interesting .The denim new pair thinner tougher feeling 515s .It n't feeling jean prior washing .The 515s never felt tough , denim thicker side side comparison.I returned based misleading product description ( mention low rise waist ) inferior quality .I gave 515s 5 star rating good previous 515s I bought high price department store .The previous 505s also great ( Fred Meyer place - though n't 505s anymore ... booo ) .So I 'm sticking 515s something change .I 'll take slightly low waist save manhood .And better quality denim mean 'll last longer anyway .So comparison : Levi 's 505 purchased 9/10/12 Amazon - 1 starLevi 's 505 purchased fall 2011 Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi 's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 Amazon - 5 starJust aware product might differ slightly described , quality appears vary order order .I suspect great divide 1 5 star review .I love Levi 's jean , I continue buy , I little careful online purchasing .And remember , buy Amazon , return exchange unwashed clothing item .",1

The cup size was not a c . It fit like a b cup. It made my breasts look wayvtoo pointy. The material is way too itchy. Not a comfortable bra. I wasted $44. On two of these bras.,1
"I was really looking forward to getting these. They were a huge disappointment. Although everything else was mostly fine, they were too small. I ordered the largest size and even though I'm well within the boundaries of the size, but I had to take them off as soon as I put them on. I'm 5'7'' and 295lbs.",1
"While these pants seem to be of good quality, they certainly aren't as advertised.  I purchased two pairs of them thinking they were made of heavyweight material, since that's what the product description says.  However, they are very lightweight and aren't good for anything other than sitting around the house.  I'll keep them just for that purpose but I am disappointed that I can't use them to go running in the cold weather (what I'd originally purchased them for).  I wish I'd have read the reviews before buying these, as others have made the exact same complaint.  The product description should be updated to say that they are lightweight.  Otherwise, it's very misleading.",1
"Pretty disappointed in this band. Low quality and too small. The edges of the band were already fraying when it came out of the package, and the velcro isn't that high of quality. I have a pretty average sized wrist, and the contact points barely met enough to keep the watch on me. To feel confident about keeping the watch on, the band would have to be tight enough to cut off circulation. Also, there are no installation instructions, so I spent about 15 minutes trying to put this band on the watch, before I had the ""oh, duh..."" moment and figured it out.I had purchased this for a Vector model. I expected more out of Suunto.....",1

This was purchased for my daughter for a Christmas gift. She liked it well enough but after one day of using it the snap that kept the wallet shut broke off. She didn't overload it but it snapped within 5 hours.,1
Four of the five masks ordered were as presented in product description and photo.  The fifth was of much lower quality and frankly looks like crap.  Not a good way to please a customer.,1
"These are not the same, updated version of the boot that Amazon claims they are.  If they were the updated, waterproof version of the boot, then they would say Timberland Waterproof on the sould of the boot, like it shows in the photos under the product description.  Instead, it only says Timberland on the soul. The boots also fit more loosely than the newer version does.  I'd return them if I could.",1
Nice shoe but the size was a little off.,1
"I really like this style of Jockey's - which is the only reason I have put up with their lack of uniformity in sizing for many years.With Jockey, sometimes a size 7 is cut like a 5, other times like a 9.  A clerk in Macy's told me years ago this is a common complaint with them.  She recommended always checking them after buying so they could still be returned.Unfortunately, this time I was too trusting.  Now I'm stuck with 6 pairs of tiny pants that I can't return.",1
I believe these to be fake Wranglers or they have let their quality slide. Very thin denim and with a crooked seem. Also missing the identifying label on the inside waste that shows the official 36 style. I'm returning them.,0
"Knock off, absolute crap, I wish I saw the reviews before I ordered...",1

"It's apparent that Lugz has went the way of the big-box stores: they have sacrificed quality in the name of lower costs. The black leather Lugz Drifter was a good, versatile boot that could take some wear and tear, and they were easy on the eyes.  Then, Lugz decided that true leather was just too costly for them. So they went to synthetic material, such as ""nubuck."" The nubuck boots look nothing like the leather Drifter, and they don't last as long, either.  The Monster II boot resembled the Drifter, but it was apparent after 2 days that there is a steep price to pay for lower cost. The Monster was torn in less than 48 hours, it couldn't be fixed because the material is so cheap, and of course since they'd been worn a couple times, they weren't covered under warranty.  I'm sure I'm not the only ex-customer who has a problem with Lugz and their new 'lower costs at any price' initiative. The switch from leather to synthetic is probably a substantual cost-cutting tool for the company. The savings that are passed along to the customer? Miniscule.  Now, the leather Drifter is all but extinct. So i'd like to thank you, Lugz, for manufacturing a quality boot for a little while. As a former customer, I will always say that Lugz started out making a quality product. As far as I'm concerned, the corporate decision-makers at Lugz decided that the customers would be satisfied with any cheap and crummy shoe that they market.  How's that working out for you, Lugz?  Fare thee well, Lugz. When another company takes your market share, I hope they make better decisions than you.",1
"Seams coming apart upon opening package.  This might last a handful more days of play, but then I'll have to toss it.Picture is after about 6 ""wearings,"" but the seams were loose out of the packaging.  Could not buy again.",0
"For the price, it was not worth it. It also didn't give a description of the size and what it was made out of.",1
The pair I received were fake. The sticker was all skewed and falling off the case and I had the luxury of having already had replacement lenses. The glasses said Radar but the lenses were totally different sizes and the attachment was different such that there is no way a Radar lenses would fit those frames.I returned them and purchased the same glasses from Zappos and the replacement lenses fit totaly fine.Please note that the colors are sold by different sellers so I'm only reviewing the seller really and not all options for this product or the product. I love the glasses.The fakes I got were the black frames.,0
It's ironic that the seller's name is Fullness because that is what this product lacked.  I had no idea they would be so thin.  Maybe some dimensions in the product description would have helped.  This was a useless waste of money.,1
"I was so devastated to find out these were fakes, the box was old and all bashed up, the quality of the shoes was so poor. I own real uggs of this same style and these were definitely fake. I just returned them.",0
The Cape is too snug around the neck so the velcro scratches.,1
"The product description says:  18 hooks for necklaces of all sizes. The one I received has only 9 hooks.Now, one of the customer photos shows how the 9 small bars at the top extend to either side, making 18 hooks. However, on the one I received, those 9 bars extend to only one side.All the other points in the description are true, [Metal with a black painted finish; Measures 13 1/2"" H x 10"" W x 4 3/4"" D; Sturdy, durable construction] but I had really hoped for more 'storage space' for my necklaces in the small area this item occupies on the dresser top.Because this item is so inexpensive, I will not be returning it. But I AM disappointed. Amazon, or whoever is responsible for this, when you change the product, please change the description to fit it!",1
"Too big.  The tag says missy fit.  No where in the product description did I see this listed as missy fit or I wouldn't have ordered them.  I ordered a petite x-small and they fit fine around the waist and rear end, but the crotch and front belly area were very baggy.  Not a flattering fit for me, I prefer a jr's fit I guess.  I haven't washed them, since I am returning them, but the material felt very scratchy when I was trying them on.  The waist was very high as well, and the length was about average for a petite fit on me.  I am 4'11"" so most petites are a little long anyway but I wear taller shoes to work in (Danskos)",1
"A convincing fake, but still a fake. If having the real thing is important for you, DON'T buy from amazon. Some people here might believe they got the real thing, but based off the pictures in their reviews, they didn't. The fake I got ticked all of the boxes that the 'fake vs real' articles mentioned, all the buttons were right and it even had the Swedish flag sewn in. Thats because the people who make the fakes are reading those articles too!!! SO even though it seems real, something about it felt off, and it was because the material was low quality and make a 'paper bag' like noise. I'm in the process of returning this one, and just got a bag from an official carrier of the brand.While it may look real, its not worth the prices that they are being sold on amazon for. Just buy it from OU, the official website, or Nordstrom.",0
"I ordered a pair of Justin Boots in size 10 EE.  You shipped a pair of 10 D which is a size I could have bought anywhere.  The outside of the box had 10 D printed on the box and you pressed a label of 10 EE over that area.  I looked inside the boot and saw 10 D.  The order was a complete waste of time and effort.  When I talked to your shipping department to return them, they constantly said that it was me that had ordered the wrong size and that the boot did not come in that size.  My husband had already tried on a 10 EE and a10 EEE in the store. Your people were bordering on rude.",1

I had a Seiko from a retail store and this box looks like it was made by someone who didn't really care.The watch itself is flimsy. I thought maybe it's light because it's titanium buy looking closely and touching it, it feels as though parts were loosely put together as if the tolerance were not important. So the connections in band make slight creaking noise like it needs oil.For the same amount of money you can get a much nicer watch which I did at Costco after shopping at various places.",0
This is the second new Timex I returned because the stem was faulty.  On this one it would not push in to start the watch.,1

Item received was way smaller than expected. Order was also missing the belt/robe tie.,0
"Love the way it looks. Love the way it feels. Love the way it works. Just one small problem that makes this product worthy of only one star.The spring bars which attach and hold the strap to the watch are too feeble and too small. The rubber band simply comes off if you apply too much pull. But with a flexible, stretchable rubber band it's unavoidable that you will pull on the band to properly wear it.Imagine you are swimming with this watch...The problem is easily fixed with a proper replacement spring bars. But it's a shame I have to go through this. Totally ruins the experience.UPDATE: Went to a jeweler to measure and fix the watch. He measured the watch and the band should be 24mm !!!!I can excuse the wrong product description. That is not a fatal mistake.The the actual pins were 22mm!!! That's why they are coming off.",1

"I am not happy about the thinness of this style of underwear.I didn't like that this style of underwear didn't have an elastic waistband because the underwear kept rolling down and it was annoying and I can't wear this with loose pants, skirt or dresses, because the fact that they roll down on their own.I did like that they fit as I expected based on the product description. I also bought the package listed below & i like these A LOT MORE! They fit great and the waistband doesn't roll down because it's made of elastic.

"what an awful costume!!  I am 6'2""  180lbs and this costume was incredibly short.  The fabric was thin.  The neck piece was too heavy and cut off the circulation in my neck, making my neck throb.  To wear the outfit you would either have to have very very high pants or have a dark shirt as the jacket isn't even near my belly button.  My wife bought this costume a few weeks before Halloween and aired out the mask in the sun in the window as it smelled so badly of rubber.  It was bad even after 2 weeks of sitting in the window on a paper towel holder,  This costume doesnt come with gloves or pants either.  The costume was so awful when I put it on at Halloween, I took it straight off and I wore last years grim reapers costume instead.  I would only buy this for perhaps a teenage, someone a lot shorter than me, then if you can look past the thin poor quality material and the horrendously smelly mask it might be an alright costume.",1

I have worn these briefs for probably 25 years (obviously I liked them) but there has been a dramatic decline in the quality of the product recently. I bought them from 2 suppliers and they were made in Costa Rica and El Salvador.

Does not bode well for them lasting several years like the old ones.,1
"I got the order on time, but not the right mask.  What I got was a cheap vinyl mask that was bent beyond repair.

The stones look like fake, cloudy plastic in any sort of light. I've had another pair of cz earrings that sparkled and were clear, so I'm certain this is not how all fake diamonds look.I'm chalking it up to wasting money on the hit and miss of ordering online, but I'm very disappointed that these were as terrible as they are with how good the reviews were. I'd planned to order two more sets from this same brand, but am now skeptical that all their product is as low-quality as this pair turned out to be.EDIT: I'm bumping the review down to one star. I wore these for a bit and really tried to like them, but it turns out I'm allergic to whatever metal this is. I'm not allergic to silver.

The leather on the wallet is not the kind that will soften nicely with wear, as my other one had. I transferred all of my stuff from the old one to the new one. The snap barely closed, but I don't have time to look for another one right now. I had always been a Buxton customer, but not any more. I will be replacing this wallet.",1

When I put them on, they were SO much tighter than the ""loose straight"" fit, almost looking like skinny jeans. Upon reading the tag, it was ""regular bootcut,"" as opposed to the ""loose"" fit that was advertised. I am disappointed with my purchase. I was going to give it 1 star, but because of Amazon's excellent return policy, it warranted an extra sympathy star.",1

The shirt is cropped--not obvious from the picture or the product description. It more resembles a ""flash-dance"" style top than a slouchy pullover. The material is thinner than the average t-shirt, more similar to summertime ""tissue tees"" than anything for keeping warm. It looks like one wash would destroy it. It's also see-through--good luck wearing it without giving the people around you a free show. The sizing is also way off. I ordered a size S regular. It looks like a child's top, or a juniors XS.

Tags inside aren't stitched as it should be. Shoe tag is so thin is practically see through and its on a flimsy plastic chain. And No Timberlands are made in Vietnam. Anyone who has owned a pair can tell the difference immediately. I will go down to the store and spend the extra $10 to get an authentic pair. The pictures of the black boot are the same size and style from a authorized Timberland dealer. While they are decent looking fakes, there are several flaws in the way they were made. Not nearly as quality as a real pair of timberlands feel. Whatever material this is made with wouldnt last a day. And my timbs last me years. And the puffy tree on the outside should be flush with the boot.",0

"When I first received this bra I was excited to finally have found something that seemed comfortable in my size ( 36 J) for nursing baby #4. The straps are wide and comfortable, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this bra. The bra does not breathe at all, causing chafing and smelly moisture. The exposed seams on the inside of the cup are extremely itchy and caused very painful cysts under my breasts. I had to wear band aids to keep the seams from rubbing on my skin. This is the worst bra I have ever had as far as comfort. Would NOT recommend!",1
"The rating is about the product description field, not the boot -- I never took the ONE boot out of the box.Yes ONE boot, not one PAIR of boots.

I am so disappointed that I had to return these. I've bought Merrell Mocs several times over the years and this is the first time I ran into a problem. The shoes were too tight.

"I am a 42H who runs and does lots of high-impact exercise.  I have been layering 3 different sports bras (1 underwire for support and 2 compression) to keep the girls in control, but even that doesn't work so well.  I heard about this ""miracle sports bra"" for larger chested women, so I decided to give it a try.  My measurements put me on the border between size 5 and size 6.  I decided tighter is better, so I ordered the size 5.  It just arrived, and I immediately put it on.  I did a few jumping jacks and still felt like I was being smacked in the face.  While it is more comfortable than 3 bras, it offers very little bounce control for my girls.  The fit is still a little loose in the size 5, so maybe a smaller size would help, although that's way off from the sizing chart.  Unfortunately, I bought it through a 3rd party on an auction website, and I can't return it.  Thankfully, though, I paid half the retail price, so at least I'm not out the extremely high regular price for this bra.  Not sure whether it's the inaccurate fit guide or the bra itself, but I wouldn't recommend buying this without trying it on if you have very large breasts.",1

But when you add all the credit cards and money and things it will hold, it is a big fat stuffed wallet-- probably just like the one you're trying to replace. I suggest not looking for something to hold Everything, but instead look for something very small to hold about 6 items of necessity, else you will always have a wallet about the same size. When full of all my stuff, it took up 1/2 a small shoulder bag. Another Amazon waste of money. Hear me Amazon? I quit. Go ahead, don't publish this.",1

This is completely senseless, even during a jump from the boat into the water for diving; no one undergoes pressure even close to 10 ATM.So if you want something water resistance, especially for diving, than you better to buy anything else.",1

"I read the poor reviews before purchasing this item - I had fair warning that it was poorly made and not as described, but my daughter loved the picture and so I ordered it anyway. This was a mistake.The costume is cute (and definitely runs small), but it's not what you see in the picture. The product description says it includes a wand and shoe decorations, but these were not included in the package; furthermore, the product image -- both on the Amazon listing and the packaging materials received -- showed that the costume has a yellow feather neck ruffle; however, the costume we received did not have this, and the feathers around the wrist were sparse and quick to fall out.I contacted the seller (7th Avenue Store) through Amazon, and they promptly and apologetically responded saying that they had sent the wrong costume, and that they would quickly ship the correct costume once I used the provided label to return the original product. I don't really understand how they could have sent the wrong costume when the packaging I received looked exactly like it did on the website, but I thanked them and promptly returned the original costume. I waited eagerly for the new costume to arrive (my daughter was very sad when I had to return it), but the next notification I received was an email that my refund had been processed by the store. I don't know whether they failed to communicate internally or if they really didn't have the correct costume as pictured on Amazon, but either way, I have found a different costume elsewhere and will avoid this seller in the future. Buyer beware!",1

"Its important to note that only the front of the costume has the patchwork print, the back is just a solid pink. I wonder how much money the manufacturer saves by not using the print for half the dress? If it was going to be solid, it would have been better for it to be a dark color. The dress did start to run in more than one place at the bottom where the dress is cut in a jagged cut (it is not hemmed) and this was after just wearing it once. The quality is not the best for what it costs, but perhaps that is what you expect of a halloween costume. Maybe we should expect more. My daughter was still excited to have a Sally costume.",1

The most obvious signs were that the engraving on the bottom of the watch face was printed on, and not actually engraved. The leather strap felt much more plastic like than the band on the genuine watch. ""Citizen 22"" is stamped into the band on both the real and fake watch, but the 22 is stamped in a larger font size on the fake. Finally, the Japan Mov't number located at the bottom of the watch face (right below the 6 hour mark) ended with - CA, not - KA like the actual Japanese movement.

"I used to wear Jockey Elance Bikini Briefs exclusively, but in the past year they have changed their design. I am a larger framed man with a 48 inch waist and I have always worn the XL size. They have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them. But the last few times I bought this product, they have a smaller, tighter fit. Very tight in the pouch and between the legs. They also have a lower cut, both in the front and back. I'm constantly pulling them up in the back. My junk is popping out of the top and the sides! These might fit a woman comfortably, but not a man. There's no stretchiness or room in the front for the boys.

So cute! Fits my 3T boy just perfectly. The problem is it was made so cheaply I have had to try and repair some things and he only had on for 10 min. The S on the front had a tear in the middle so it started peeling off. The Velcro to hold it in came off and the red pieces weren't aligned when made so the brief part is crooked.

I spent a lot of time looking for a warm winter boot that also looked good. The product description and photo of this boot seemed to line up with what I was looking for. I live in NH and need a warm boot - because of that I tend to trust Canadian made products (I mean - they know cold). I searched all over the web trying to find out where this boot was made. Zappos had many great reviews - only one bad review. I should have listened to that one bad review. The boot just looks and feels cheep.

I would have given a zero if I could. Wishom was who I bought these through. Third party seller. They are fake. I called them out on them being fakes and they refunded my money right away. Very fishy. Came from Hong Kong. Very upset Amazon is allowing them to sell fakes. They were good fakes. I ordered the same color and size from TOMS website and compared them side by side. The fakes were off on color. Too stiff. Couldn't bend the soles. The size was way off for an 8.  The sticker and flag they came with were off. This store was not an authorized dealer and should have researched more.  The fakes were good if you didn't know better. The real ones were softer material. Not stiff. The sole was bendable. The stitching was better. The flag and sticker looked like the other two I have. I have purchased two other pairs through TOMS website before.  The differences were there between the real ones and the knock offs.  They real TOMS sometimes require a couple times wearing them to break them in. I have a pair I have owned for three years and they are durable with average use. These fakes were so stiff I would have blisters instantly.,0
"I ordered these for my girlfriend because she wanted ones with darker lenses. When the came in the mail, I immediately compared them to her original ones because I was skeptical after having read all the stories about the fake ones out there. I had done my homework...and these would have easily passed as ""real"" if my girlfriend had bought them herself and didn't think twice. The cheap plastic frame was scratched above the left lens, and there was no engraved ""RB"" on the lens. The frame on the new ones look and feel more ""toy-store"" made as if they were from a large production factory; compared to the sturdier, handmade frames of the original ones. Don't get fool paying good money. Make sure you're getting the real deal.",0
"Updated one month after purchase: I have now walked over 50 miles in these boots. They were gradually becoming more comfortable and then they took a turn for the worse. Once again I came home with bloody socks. On closer inspection, I see that the patch of fake leather sewn into the back of the boots just above the heel is cracked and breaking apart. The resulting sharp edges (photo attached) are what wore through my skin. Ive only had these boots for one month. They are not even fully broken in and already they are wearing out. Im dropping my rating to one star since zero is not an option.Update a couple weeks after purchase: I've now logged about 20 miles in these boots and they are now showing a  noticeable improvement in comfort. Another 20 miles and I may be able to wear them all day long without them wearing sores on my ankles. Im adding a 4th star.Original review: These boots gouge into the back side of my ankle bone at every step rubbing it raw. I've logged about 8 miles in them so far with little if any sign of the problem letting up. I'm confident that they will break in and be fine, but so far they've created quite a bit of pain and discomfort. They may turn out to be 5 star boots, but right now I have to be generous to give them 3.",0

"Sadly I must revise my review as I believe the sandals I received were fake, very good fakes, but still fake. I returned them and ordered from the Birkenstock website instead. There were several things that tipped me off: the box was correct, but you should never judge a shoe by its box. They had a terrible smell of plastic when I recived them, both pairs of real birks I have bought smell like leather. There was so much glue in between the straps and the cork on my shoes and that should always be a red flag, especially for a brand known for quality. There is no glue in between the straps on the shows I bought directly from their website. These shoes are the same price on the official Birkenstock website so I woks advise going there just to be safe.",0

"I have ordered several pairs of of Levi's 512 boot cut jeans over the last few years.  The fit of these was nothing like my previous 512's.  At least two sizes smaller! The legs were waaaay too short. Normally I would have to hem them (I'm 5' 4"")  or wear with a pretty high heel.  For this pair, I had to take the hem completely out to lengthen but couldn't gain much more than 1/2 inch which was still too short with sneakers.  Besides the fit that is nowhere near the 'real' 512's, the other odd thing that made me wonder if they were knock offs was that the product description states they are  98% Cotton/ 2% Elastane , same as my old ones but the actual tag on these jeans says they are 84% cotton / 14% polyester / 2% Elastane.  Because of the great fitting ones I have had in the past, I might try one more pair but will check them carefully as soon as they arrive!",1
cheap looking vinyl not leather as advertised. i waited too long to open the delivery and now stuck with these crappy boots. the fit is poor and they look very chintzy. money down the drain. very unhappy with purchase.,1
I took extra caution while putting these on and they still ripped. Got to the knee and a big hole started. I had a long dress so my knees were not showing.  I wore them for wedding pictures then threw them away.,1
"So, I had high hopes for these as the box stated it was for people my height 5'2"" and fits women up to 230lbs. I am 225 lbs, so I was pushing the top of the weight limit. First off, mine had a hole already in them when they arrived. So that was a negative. Then I decided to try them on even though they had a hole. Yeah, I felt like I was going to bust through them and could barely get them above my thighs. These definitely won't fit larger petite women unless they have smaller thighs. I would recommend going up a size or 2.",1

These are not the same Reef Smoothy flip flops I bought years ago.  The 10s were a full 1/2 inch smaller than the 10s I bought years ago.  My old 10s were a little big and these 10s were too small.  The quality was poor too. The materials weren't as soft or flexible as my originals. I'm not sure if these are fake or if Reef quality and design has gone downhill that much.I returned these and will buy Tevas.  They are more comfortable.,0

"Listed size chart is way off. Even with thick socks on these boots are almost a full size too big. I ordered a 5M/37 even though a 37 is usually a 6 or 6.5 in the US, and they're STILL too big. Love the boots but now I have a pair of useless, and expensive boots.",1

"We bought this costume to match the costume of Jack Skellington for a party. Although in its description, it says that the back of the costume is solid pink lace, I think that this is something that has to be put in BIG BOLD letters, as it makes the costume simply unwearable. Just imagine: from the front, the costume doesn't look so bad, but once you turn around... it's a pink bathrobe! How awesome, two pieces of clothing in one! The wig is a whole new story - only 1/3 of it actually has hair, the rest is PINK too!I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that this is the official Disney licensed costume...By the way, it looks like the other review was left by the shop that sells this junk.

"Initially these were my absolute favorite everyday nylons--they look really natural, very sheer. However, I then went and purchased them in black and grey for some variety, and they developed tiny snags just from putting them on the very first time out of the package. It's particularly noticeable in the black ones, since you can see little spots that are darker. I went to wear the nude colored ones for the second time and saw that they had similar snags, albeit less noticeable. And then after a couple of hours of wear they ripped in gusset. These are much too delicate to wear more than once (or, in the case of the black ones, even once).",1

I am very disappointed in the product.  It's a very cheap product that I would not have wanted to buy at the dollar store for a $1.  I paid WAY MORE than that.And the delivery service was EXTREMELY disappointing.  I ordered it based on the delivery date.  But it ended up being 2 weeks much later .. for a total of 4 weeks for delivery.  And there was no tracking number on it.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0

This shoe does not offer the traditional Merrell fit. Loose and wide. Had to return.,1
"I had to search through pages and pages of my past orders to find this item, just so I can write a bad review. The parts used on this bag are so cheap, I want other people to know. DO NOT buy this backpack. I've had this backpack for less than a year, but on my 3rd time using it, the fake metal clasp that hold shoulder strap in place, just break. I had about 10 pounds in there... Just a camera, and some clothes... And then, when I decided to put it over my shoulder with just one strap so I don't have to hand carry the bag, the 2nd clasp breaks exactly the same way. Steer clear of this product. I keep on having to learn the hard way, that in the end you ALWAYS get what you pay for. This product is complete garbage. Please do not purchase.",0
"I ordered the cognac version, but it looked more dusty brown and not like the photo at all. The quality of the shoe is poor--cheap leather and other materials, and they seemed quite flimsy as well. I sent mine back.",1
"You get what you pay for I guess. They snagged a few places just as I was putting them on, and had a huge run down the middle just a few hours in. I know it happens, but I can't say that I've ever had it happen right away in such a short amount of time. I ended up tossing them in the bathroom trash half way through the night and braving the cold bare-legged.",1
This JUST barely survived our production of the Wizard of Oz. It literally fell apart the day after we wrapped up our play.,1
"I'm accustomed to Dansko, Sanita, and Allegria shoes, which are all very comfortable, but require a break in period. I'm ok with that. But these never seemed to get broken in. Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands. I'm on my feet 9 hours a day, on concrete, walking around and up and down stairs, for several miles a day, sometimes with long periods standing (I'm an adult-education instructor). I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time, and was hoping these would be it. I wear a 10 (40) in women's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well (thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order) but they just aren't the shoe for me.",1

Poor fit,1
"I know there is a great deal of confusion about sizing so I'm going to try to help with that. In expensive dress shoes and tennis shoes, I almost always wear a size 9 1/2.....never a 9 but sometimes a 10. I ordered a size 9 in these shoes and they looked  like 'clown shoes' on my feet. I returned them and ordered a size 8 and they are just about perfect although ever so slightly larger than my usual shoes. I can't imagine why they use such unusual sizing but I hope this information will be helpful. If you order a size and a half smaller than usual, I feel sure they will be right...or very close.Now......the not so good part. I am 66 years old and grew up wearing Converse tennis shoes all through the 1960s; they were great shoes in every respect. If your experience is similar, you will immediately realize that these shoes are in almost no way, comparable. These look similar but they wear more quickly and aren't nearly as comfortable; even the laces are of very poor quality.",1

"Although the product description leads you to believe this is slim and sleek it turned out to be anything but.  Before I finished taking it out of the box I could tell that I was probably going to have to return it, and after putting it on very briefly I did just that.  This is just like all the other bulky Fossil watches but with a square face.  If you are looking for something thin/slim to wear under a dress shirt sleeve then look elsewhere.",1

I ordered a size 10 women's size and the recipient I ordered it for was sent a size 10 MEN's size.  It is very frustrating when Amazon doesn't deliver the merchandize as ordered especially when it was a birthday gift.  Returning it by the receiver is a burden that was not part of the gift.,1
What the heck was this?  It was a bamboo pole that was cracked with some weeds attached at the end.  The size is less than a yard stick.  Not a good buy.  Very poor construction.,1
"This bra was a bit too big in the cups for me.  Nothing I couldn't live with.  Also, the material felt cheap and like it probably wouldn't last long.  Again, nothing I couldn't live with for the price of the bra.  But what I I could not live with is this bra is extremely POINTY.  I felt like Madonna when she used to wear the cone bras!!  Now if you like the pointy look this is the bra for you.  Sorry to say this bra will be returned.",1
"The underwire in this bra cuts into my under arm. Very painful. Also, the cups create the a pointed breast look. The straps are thin and the metal clasp that controls the length of the straps is very flimsy. I've worn Bali bras for years and feel very disappointed in this product.",1

"The color I chose according to the color options was ""natural white,"" which the pictures also showed that I was ordering a creamy-white color, but the color I received was ""white."" Also the sizes are in women's not men's, and I ordered according to men's sizes, therefore it is way too small for me. Normally when you buy converse they are bought in men's sizes, and this is not the case, so order according to your actual size if you are a woman, and be weary of the color choices. Otherwise the shoes are legitimately Converse",1

"Got this as a replacement for another black duffel which served me well but was showing some wear and tear (on seam had popped and had it sewn up and the strap was torn).The bag is voluminous and can carry enough for a long trip.  The U-shapped opening makes making easy. The end compartments are very handy for keeping stuff you may want to access quickly  or keep away from the main compartment (like liquids in one's shaving kit).I was disappointed with delivery however. The bag arrived without a strap, ironically the only thing I really needed to replace on my former bag. No big deal...I contacted the company and they said they'd send out another. I was traveling from overseas to the States and had about 25 days before I departed. Unfortunately I didn't receive the replacement and checked back with them about a week out.  The customer contact rep said that the shipping department said there was a problem with my address and they hadn't sent it out yet (keep in mind this was about 2 1/2 weeks after they promised to send it to me).  Apparently my Army Post Office (APO) address in Afghanistan threw them for a loop because APO goes in the city spot, and AE (Armed Forces Europe) goes in the state spot, and the zip is an east coast zip code.  This is a red flag that an ""outdoor"" company, whose products are probably disproportionately purchased by military or military-affiliated consumers, is not familiar with an APO address.Regardless, they sent the strap to my destination in the States so I could use of it for half my trip. It was fine for the trip from Afghanistan to Dubai and Dubai to New York. But I noticed it had been torn somehow, which didn't strike me as very durable on its maiden voyage. I made two more short trips in the States and was performing ok. However, upon my return trip to Afghanistan the plastic D bracket on the bag on which the shoulder strap clips onto broke. I was only carrying about 40 lbs and it just popped while I was walking across a parking lot.Given the customer service, the lack of durability on the fabric itself, and the poor performance of the parts, I cannot recommend this product for anyone wanting to travel more than once a year or carry more than 30 lbs.",0

I'm pretty sure these Toms are fakes. I really wanted them quick so I ordered them from Amazon because I had a Prime Trial. Well I noticed when I got them the Toms logo on the back was kinda crooked but thought it was just like that. I then wore them and within a day of wearing them all the information on the insole was already worn off. My Toms that I purchased from Toms website still have all the wording on them even with the holes I have worn into the soles of the shoes! Within less than a month the insoles are coming out. Now the fabric is coming off of the inside of the shoe. I have had these a little over 2 months and I am very disappointed that I was duped to buying them on here. If you want Toms just buy them on their website or from one of their vendors!! The place that these came from was TwoZeroFive but I'm pretty sure what ever shop Amazon gets these from they are all fakes!,0

"Edit: I returned these sandals and ordered directly from the Teva website (where the images still show the older version), and got the same style as what I received on Amazon. This means that the sandal is probably not a fake, and I apologize for making the claim. However, everything negative I have said below is still true. I am very sad to see that the Teva sandal has gone downhill. The quality is now terrible and I will need to be looking for a new favorite summer show.Original Review: The black on black sandal is a knockoff! I have owned this exact brand and style of black/black Teva olawahu sandal in a size 8 for over five years. Three different pairs- all purchased from DSW or online from Teva. I purchased on Amazon because of the cheaper price and Prime shipping. When I received the sandal, the foam part of the sandal is cheaper and not as dense as the genuine Teva sandals. Also, the straps across the top are a tad narrower and are rough and scratchy. They started tearing up the top of my foot within a couple minutes of wearing them. Repeat Teva owners will tell you these sandals do not scratch your feet and are some of the most comfortable sandals in the world. The design is pretty similar to authentic sandals. The only dead giveaway in design that this is a fake product is the different logo insignia where your heel lies and on the outer strap. There should be a rectangular plastic logo. The knockoff has the Teva logo that is just kind of etched into the foam and a fabric logo sewn into the strap. Also, the cheap Foam of the knockoff sandals attracts cat hair and fuzz like no other. My genuine Tevas have never done this. Along the bottom of the sole of each sandal, the middle area seems to be this same material that attracts cat hair. Again, real Teva sandals do not do this. You can see in the photo the differences.",0

This last 2 pairs, I bought in the last month of 2016 were awful. The zipper and the product has become cheap. The zipper failed on the first pair within a day. The second pair it failed after 3 times of wearing them. The zipper will not work and the quality of the boot feels cheaper with fake leather now. They need to bring these boots back to America to be made and maybe the quality will return.",0

"Generally appears to be well made and sturdy, but they have changed the fit. I have worn the Dickies 13"" shorts to work  for about a decade and normally buy one or two new pairs every summer. The old style really were ""loose fit"" plenty roomy everywhere, easy to move in and loose enough to be a little ""breezy"" on really hot days. New for 2017, the fit is smaller, particularly there is less room in the ""seat"" of the shorts. Also, the waist of the shorts fit higher on my waist, .....(think ""mom-jeans.......) I usually buy relaxed fit or loose fit pants in order to fit my shape, however, this ""loose fit feels like ""loose fit for skinny people"", does not fit well if you need a little more room in the seat and thigh area.All in all nicely made shorts, with a troublesome (not so loose) fit",1

They also were not very soft, and very delicate--mine already had a hole in one leg when they arrived, I tried them on simply to see if it would be worth ordering another pair, and I think not.By comparison, Hanes Silk Reflections Silky Sheer are much softer and while still sheer, provide a bit more coverage.",1

It is a shame because Buxton use to be a quality product, but this wallet is cheaply made in Vietnam. I will never buy another Buxton product and I will be mindful from now on to read the one star reviews before I purchase anything on Amazon again because others mentioned the plastic interior and poor quality. Not very trusting of Amazons product discriptions after this experience. Why is this product still being promoted as all leather when it is clearly not? Very disapointed.",1

"Tried it because you haven't had a wide in a while, but too narrow",1
Should of read the reviews first. These are obviously knock off after wearing them for less than two months. I have maybe worn these 4 times since the date of purchase and the DC emblems fell off after they got wet. WTF! I have worn DC shoes most of my adult life and have never had a shoe fall apart like this. DC shoes have lasted me at the least a year and a half at the least but these are worthless after just two months. I will never buy a product from this company ever again and will make sure everyone I know here on Amazon knows about your fake product.,0
"I bought these for my 26yo son because he can never find a size 7 in black.  He loves the Chuck Taylor All Stars and will not wear anything but.  Got these and wore them about 2 months, doesn't wear them all day or every day because he has work shoes he wears to work, and the sole of the right shoe cracked starting at the heel going toward the toes.  He noticed it last night when it was raining and his foot was wet from the bottom up.  This makes me so mad.  To think you pay good money for something that only lasts 2 months and you're left having to buy another pricey pair of shoes.  There is no customer service I can complain to or get a refund from.  Don't buy these high priced cheaply made shoes.",1
"After seeing all of the positive review for these shoes, I decided to give them a try.I was not impressed. The shoes run slightly large which is no big deal because I can exchange them, but they did not feel comfortable to me at all. They felt clunky and cheaply made in my opinion.",1
"This Belt is a CHEAP piece of crap! My husband has and used this belt less than 2 weeks. I did not see anything in the product description that it is a Leather veneer constructed belt. This ""cheap"" belt's veneer is coming apart!!",1
 The product description say leather backing leather .The top surface belt man made .Very poor quality .Very disappointed Dickies Amazon .,1
"I was looking for a larger catch all bag and this did not meet my expectations on many levels1. The shape, placement of the zipper, and the interior clips that let you change the shape are all awkward and not functional for my use.  I dump my purse wherever it lands.  The zipper on the purse does not completely close the top of the purse.  So the contents are not secure.2. Not as large as I was hoping. Probably should have read product description closer. One reviewer mentioned putting a change of clothes in the bag.  I can see putting a pair of jeans and almost nothing else.3. Just not the quality I was hoping for. But for $20 it made a nice hand me down to my boyfriends daughter.",1
The glasses that I have received did not match and its fake!! the printing on the side came off and there is no cloth to clean and no manual.I won't buy again from this company,0
I have worn birkenstocks since 1992 and was looking forward to these.  Unfortunately they are so cheap and nothing that I would expect from Birkenstock.  I returned them right away.  The inside foot bed can be removed but doesn't stay in place and they are super uncomfortable.  My husband was thrilled I was sending them back because he called them ugly.  Unfortunate because I LOVE birks!,1
Feels sturdy.  There were a lot of credit card slots and storage BUT you can not fill them all up because it will not close properly.  It's bulky on top side and skinny on the bottom if you fill up all the slots.  AND the credit card and ID slots are too tight that it is hard to remove them.  Will use it but will not recommend it and will not buy this again.,1

"I am very disappointed by these shoes. I've worn Converse sneakers my whole life but these specific shoes from Amazon are terrible quality.

"I think the idea of using words is good, but the dials don't include all the letters.  Thus, I couldn't use the words that I wanted to.

"If I could give a zero for these I would. I have bought these exact boots, well what were supposed to be the exact boots from Aerosole, at there store and these are nothing like them. These are awful. Nothing like the ones I have, these are either fake or factory rejects. Do not get them.",0
I paid full price for what I expected to be a new pair of shoes. Nowhere in the product description did it indicate that I would be purchasing a disgusting used product. They were dirty and smelt bad and worn down! And even had another persons shipping information on a packing slip inside the box. VERY upset and disappointed.,1
I also don't like how they look at all!!,1
" I bought case product description said would fit even large sunglass .I wanted able use one case either regular glass sunglass .I read review saying case fit season 's large sunglass .Mine moderate size.When case arrived I impressed thick leather spring-loaded closing .The red good color .Once I tried put sunglass , thing became frustrating .Because leather robust , I able stretch make case useable I find another case actually fit sunglasses.I recommend regular glass .",1
"Sizing was completely wrong as if they were fakes. I ordered a 32x30 and the ones I received were 32x30 but the length was like 4 inches longer than all my other pairs I currently own.

"Bought this item for a costume party and wish I would have seen the review stating it is not what it appears.

I looked everywhere for this costume online and this appeared to be the best one. It's not.",0

"I'm a 32DDD. This bra lift and seperates very well and the band has four rows of hooks. But the cup gives a very pointy shape to the breast. The material feels scratchy as well. If you want to look like Madonna in the cone bra getup, then this is the bra for you.",1
The box says 10 month infants but they are clearly a 10 toddler. I kept them because the child will use them when there 2 or 3.,1
"First, the skirt is not that dark black color. It is a very sheer black fishnet material, over another equally as sheer orange/pink fishnet material, over another sheer fishnet material. Not at all the product you see here. The skirt itself does not have that curve to it, that the picture has. Instead it sticks out and looks like a too too, but without the nice ruffles.The shirt part of the dress was extremely tight for a standard size. The poka dotted breast area, is so tiny that it does not even cover where the breasts should be. Not even a push up bra works. If you are a woman with breasts, do not get this. If you are a woman with anything up there, do not get this item. Standard size must not put into account the idea of an upper body part.This item has no zipper to get it on or off easily. I personally was able to get it on, but had to cut myself out of it, since the material decided to attach to my skin! The breast problem did not help with this situation.The necklace and belt are very cheap. The belt is connected with little fake leather straps that are not even equally sewn together or equally spaced. You could see the white in the fake leather that attached it.The hair pieces are pretty cheap and flimsy too.The only thing niceish was the fishnet gloves.You would be better off going to Johann Fabrics or somewhere like and making this item. It would be better.I was very much not satisfied with this item and sadly, because I had to cut it off me, I cannot send it back.DO NOT GET THIS, I do not know what the heck I was thinking.",0
" The company I got costume awful .When I got costume , missing glove .The company would n't let return .If n't , would okay .The costume n't bad .The dress look good , wig horrible .The wig lot bald spot hardly worth using .I would definitely recommend buying different red wig .I actually ended finding better Sally costume , one still look good .Buy want , n't spend much money .It look cheap .",0
 I paid good money boot sent worn new scratched .But boot nice thought I buying new used .,0
"Very low quality, not worth the 40+dollars I spent on this costume, the fabric was almost rag quality, the costume looks nothing as good as the picture an the bib used is crap. Will never use this company again.",1
The boots is missing and not included in the package as stated.  The material is not of good quality compare to the price of the outfit. I was forced to buy this outfit as my 4 year old son is really into it.  He's kind of excited for awhile and lost interest later.,0
"Very cute costume, however, the waste was torn and the bottom was frayed, it was only to be used once so I kept it. Not something I will be able to give away or sell. Also, the fake necklace that was included was melted to the package and was completely useless.Also, I ordered my daughter's size and it could not even get far past her head so I had to get a larger size which was still a little snug. I could not return the smaller costume because it was sold via a third party and could not get in touch with anyone to return.",0

There was nothing wrong with this product.  I don't wear gold.  The product description should include the color of the case.  My monitor made it look silver.  It doesn't even indicate if it's a men's or women's watch. I returned the item promptly.  It's a men's watch by the way although the size would have been fine with me.,1
"These pantyhose are ridiculously too small. The waist is way too short and tight!  The crotch is too short!  Why don't pantyhose makers make the waist higher and bigger around?  This brand gave me a terrible muffin top!  What is ridiculous about the size is I read many reviews before deciding to order this brand.  I read a lot of good reviews how people liked this brand.  One person noted the waist was too short, so I purposely ordered the size larger than my range.  The size I ordered goes up a full 40 pounds more than what I weigh and I'm only 5'4"" - my legs are normal for my size - the crotch did not even come all the way up!  I was stuck and had to wear them.  They were extremely uncomfortable!  The waist was way too low!  After a couple of hours and keeping adjusting in the bathroom I was finally able to get the crotch all the way up, but the waist was still way too low!  Too bad for me I made a bad choice of ordering 4 pairs of this brand!  I wear a lot of dresses and go through a lot of pantyhose.  I will be going back to wearing Legs and Spanx though they are more expensive at least they fit right. I don't understand not being able to buy the size range that my body fits in and them not fitting!  It must be the makers are not using the right sizes or the models they use have all their weight above their waist!  My body is average and I'm not bigger on the bottom than the top - so this is really ridiculous.  These nylons themselves on the legs are not bad for strength but they became baggy at my ankles by the end of the day while my waist was being cut by a size that was supposed to fit someone 40 pounds more than me.  Can u tell this upsets me?",1
"If you're taller than about 6-ft, don't waste your money; these will not fit you. Only the lower back straps are elastic. The over-shoulder and front straps are not elastic and have absolutely no ""give."". Incidentally, the lower back straps and the over-shoulder front straps are ""generically"" navy blue but nowhere close to a color or fabric match. I chose to not waste time returning the item for a few dollars after shipping and instead gave them to charity.",1
I bought this for my grandson. This is by far the worse costume I have ever bought. The ears do not even stand up. but just flop around. I had to reinforce them and still not the best. The rest of the costume collects lint and hair instantly. I tried it on him and he had it on for a half an hour and it was covered. I have spent an hour removing all of it. Also the ears do not even come close to fitting correctly on the head. Way to small and he wears a size 3T. Unfortunatley I cannot send it back because of a party this weekend he has to wear it too. Would not recommend this costume at all. Very poorly made.,1
Looks pretty good but it is an inferior product. I wore it for a week and the sole started pealing away on the right side from the front. Very disappointing. I'm not sure if it is a lower quality model or a fake. I have always had Reef sandals and this one felt a little lighter at first and it was a lot cheaper than I normally pay so I thought I had a deal but it wasn't.,0
"These nylons were too small, and I ordered then per weight specifications on the label. I was able to wear them, but during wearing them, the toe area got a hole--bummed, (they were even reinforced toes)--not very happy with a ""one time wear only"" purchase.",1
"I can't say that I am too happy with this shoe. They really are not very comfortable, and the couple of times I have worn them for an extended period I couldn't wait to get them off. The part that you are standing on feels like there is a bar or something protruding and pushing up against the outside of my sole, up against the outside bone. Maybe these were made incorrectly, but I don't think they will ever feel broken in and comfortable.",1
Received the costume today for a very excited 4 yr old who is really disappointed because the headpiece is not in the package even though the product description says it is included. We cannot use this for Halloween without the head piece and it's probably too late to get another one in timeOn further inspection the cape is missing as well ...Very disappointed that I now have to look for and find an alternate costume this close to Halloween,1
Not original Ray Ban sunglasses.  I'm not a expert by far but they are definitely fakes.  I still do like them but would not pay that much for something that is not real.  Price point should be 1/4 of the selling price.  I gave two stars for effort.,0

"The insoles cannot be removed, so you can't replace them with better ones.  Why wasn't this in the product description?  I'm returning them and asking Amazon to update the description so other people don't waste their time.  Maybe this was a recent change, since I see comments from other people about putting in different insoles.Also, these shoes feel about twice as heavy as other low-tops.",1

"Ever since they moved production to India, Rockport's been having problems. Whoever is in charge of Quality Control is either asleep or, well, let's skip the libel suit and go straight to the facts: the pair in question, while labeled as a US size 11 XW (extra wide), was neither an 11 (too short - more like a 10.5) or an XW (too narrow - more like a W (wide) ). Don't take my word for it: look at the other one-star ratings here on Amazon, or the latest ratings at L.L. Bean.NB: the overall high rating these shoes have comes from the years the shoes were made in China and Vietnam.While I'm at it, Amazon also gets one star for failing to vet their vendors.

"I bought this a while back and have owned Fossil watches all my life and this one is so fake. First off it is light as a feather and has NO weight to it at all. Second it is not even a real thick glass on the face (it's thin and scratches really easily). Third, the back of this thing is a snap on cover that looks like it would come off a $10 watch from a vending machine. I have emailed the seller about this and even after sending it back I still have not gotten a refund. The guts of this thing are in no way shape or form anything better. It has a small electrical board that controls the hands and that's it. There are no gears like a real Fossil watch.This was a big waste of time ordering this watch. It is cheap and if you want to piss away $90 on this to break on you in 2 weeks then go for it.",0

However, upon receiving the item, seeing there was no fleece lining, I rechecked the description for this robe.  It is a robe made of the cheap material used for all Halloween costumes that will last one Halloween.  The ""clasp"" is a mechanism that you have to attach to both sides of the robe that will easily rip the material.  This is not a warm robe to wear on a chilly Halloween night.  That being said, my 8 year old son is thrilled with it because of the emblem and the hood.  It is probably not worth the money I spent on it.  Be careful when you read other reviews to match it with the actual product description!",1

"I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price.  It's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples.  The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions, causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose.  It felt uncomfortable (not too tight - just too rough) as soon as I put it on.Because it's a Bali, it's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just can't get over the positive reviews so I'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra, try a Victoria's Secrets wireless cotton bra.  It gives you the smooth coverage you want, excellent support, and you won't even know you are wearing it.",1

"Fit great, good control top, but CLINGY!  And not static cling either, it is the hosiery itself, it's like sandpaper because they are NOT silky at all.  The inside is comfortable on the skin, but the outside, the part that touches the clothes, is very sandpaper-feeling, so If you are wearing any kind of silky or flouncy dress at all, FORGET IT, your clothes will cling like there's no tomorrow.  I am just glad that it was summer when I was wearing these, because I literally could not walk more than 2 feet before my dress was ""glued"" to my legs and getting shorter with every step.  I had to go to the ladies room to take the hose off and go bare legged.  (As an older lady, I prefer to wear hose, although I now it is more fashionable not to in the summer.)",1

Well, the sticker that they put on the package says it's the correct size, but the ACTUAL package says the size is Queen. And, if you flip the package over and look at the size chart, it says Queen/Petite and that they fit someone who is 5'0"" to 5'4"". I'm 5'9"", so I didn't bother trying them on because I already know the crotch will be at my knees. I returned the first pair hoping that it was just a fluke, but nope - I just got the new package and it's the same thing... the sticker says it's the right size, but it's really not. The wedding I'm going to is in 2 days, so I guess I have to go scour my crappy local stores for some decent nylons that will actually fit me.I noticed a lot of the reviews say that the nylons run tight/short.

Because the leather is robust, I have been able to stretch it to make the case useable while I find another case that can actually fit my sunglasses.I do recommend it for regular glasses.",1
"I liked them at first, they looked fine and were comfortable. However towards the end of the day a huge tear showed up where the top ""reinforced"" fabric met the more sheer fabric. That was disappointing. The hem of my dress (which went to a few inches above my knee) barely covered the bottom of the run. The rest of the tights were fine, but I guess pulling up these tights (I have short/dull fingernails) more than a few times a day is a bit too much for these tights to handle.",1

I tried them for short walks and they seemed to be uncomfortable but I thought they would break in. I was wrong, I wore them to DIsney-land and these shoes ruined my trip. I had to take them off constantly to give my feet break. At hotel I noticed my feet was bleeding, I am not kidding or exaggerating. The shoe just squeezed my toes so tightly that one of my toe nails just cut through other toe. The upper is advertised as  to be made of leather, but feels like low quality hard, plastic with fuzz on it to make it look like suede. The sole is also made of some kind of hard plastic. The sole is so narrow that shoe gives no lateral support at all, it feels like walking with roller-blades. The quality is just not there and they charge outrageous price for it. I had Rockport shoes, same size, same style from Costco for about half the price of these ""shoes"", and they are great. These shoes are almost new, Amazon will not take it back, so they are going straight to the trash. Do not believe the good reviews like I did.",1

My friend could smell it from all the way across the room!  Even if the smell could be removed (which I doubt) the bag looks cheap, especially the shoulder strap, which isn't like a purse strap, but more like the strap you would see on a cheaply made backpack. Not worth $20 at all. I'm returning this bag tomorrow! Ewwwwwwwwwww, stinky P.U!!",0

"I typically don't set my expectations for pantyhose very high since I've never met a pair that could last longer than a couple of months. Having said that, these pantyhose were disappointing anyway. I've owned two pairs. My first purchase was the taupe and this turned out to be too pink/purple for my Asian skin tone (medium with a warm undertone). Understanding that colors can be difficult to gauge online, I tried again and the natural was a much better purchase. Unfortunately, neither pair lasted more than three wears before getting holes ripped up the thighs. I'm typically very careful with my pantyhose. I hand-wash them carefully, I don't do any active activities in them other than walking and sitting, and I keep my nails trimmed as well. I won't be purchasing another pair.",1

"I bought these because they were cheap enough to use, one at a time, on twenty minute drives home when it's really cold here in Jersey from December to February. My plan was to open one before I would leave work and alternate the warmer between my driving hand and my free hand. I assumed that these would be hotter than putting my hand over the heating vent, but they're not. Maybe a fistful (five or so) of these things would be adequate to warm a cold hand. The packages can be split  to only expose one at a time to air, so that's good.The other problem with these is that they don't give off their maximum level of heat until around an hour after opening, so they're useless for those who would like some spontaneous heat.So...yeah, there is an exothermic reaction going on here, but not anything on the level that the product description would lead one to believe.",1

"I wear a 36DD, and I'm always on the lookout for a good minimizer. I really wanted to like this bra. I have the Bali Satin Tracings bra, and aside from the seam across the bust (which can make wearing certain shirts impossible), I've been really pleased with it. However, in addition to that same seam issue, this bra has at least two major drawbacks for me. First, and most importantly, it's super pointy. It's definitely the case that it gives you a conical shape. On the one hand I can understand a slight conical shape, as minimizers are supposed to hold the bulk of your breast close to the chest -- hence the cone shape. Yet, this bra made me so pointy that it defeated this purpose, as the ""points"" extend really far forward! Second, for me, this bra doesn't do much in terms of separation. It feels a bit like a sports bra, in the sense that it feels like my boobs are being smushed together in the front. I think this is partly due to the strap placement. The pictures above don't really show this, but the straps are more toward the center of the breast, rather than toward the outer edge as most bra straps are. The effect is a slight pull toward the center, which creates the sports-bra-like, uniboob sensation. Not fun. Overall, I would not recommend this bra.",1

I order this watch hoping that I would get it in around 4 days because was Monday when placed order but still no luck there it is now going to take 11 days to get to me by ups. I'm hope that the watch was worth the money could have walked to where this watch was sold from by now and picked it up. 11 days ground delivery is nuts because I live less than 4000 miles away from the place watch is coming from. Will update when get the watch I hope it was worth the money and time.,0

"Do not purchase these from Frames Direct!  They are fake.  However, I will admit that they are the best knock offs that I have seen.  The markings and packaging seem to be correct.  When I got them, something just didn't feel right about them.  So I purchased another, genuine pair from an authorized dealer and compared them.  This is when I noticed some glaring differences.  The plastic from the FramesDirect pair just wasn't right.  It felt cheaper, lighter, and more brittle when compared with the genuine pair.  Admittedly, most people probably wouldn't be able to tell just by looking from a few feet away.  The biggest giveaway was the presence of seems in the plastic on the top of the frames and the earpieces. This is a byproduct of a cheap manufacturing process using molds.  Genuine Ray Bans will not have any seams.  Bottom line, they are a good fake but not worth $65.",0

I was so disappointed when I tried it on.  If you call being mashed flat, it's supportive.  Comfortable...not after you hook it up.

The front slaps down hard because they are so bulky and stiff, and actually made my ankles sore from working so hard.  Wore them 5 or 6 times thinking maybe they would wear in a little.  Nope.  Threw them away and bought some actual nice nursing shoes that feel like I am walking on air.  Total waste of money.",1

While they have the Dickie's look that I like and are well made, these shorts run VERY small. My husband (and son)3 already owns several pairs of this brand of shorts and pants, so I know his size (Dickie's tend to run a tad bit small) and how they fit. Armed with this information, I bought 2 pairs in his current size for this brand. But when he put them on, he couldn't even button them! They are a full 2-3 inches small! They say they're a 36 waist,  but my son who wears a 32 can almost wear them! So, if you are ordering these shorts you should upsize about 2 inches. Other than the significant size difference, they seem to be good shorts.",1

"After years of searching for the ""perfect jeans,"" I finally discovered Lucky Brand, and have worn them exclusively for many years. In the past, I've always bought directly from the store. When ordering online, I decided to conduct an experiment (given the inconsistency in ratings): I ordered one pair from Amazon's site, and another directly from the manufacturer.  The two are absolutely identical in title: 181 Relaxed Straight, same waist & inseam, and all the logos & insignias on the product match completely.  To be honest, they look exactly the same.However, these two jeans could not be more different. The denim used in the ""official"" pair is soft, cozy, velvety, maybe even luscious. In contrast, the denim used in the pair from Amazon is rough, stiff, scratchy, and generally uncomfortable.  I wanted to discredit the latter as a cheap knock-off, but as I wrote, it unequivocally bears the seal of the Lucky Brand company.After looking closely, I was finally able to find a subtle deviation in the ""style"" code hidden underneath the tags.  The good pair is coded 7M10828, whereas the bad ones have 7M11748.  At the time of this writing, this code can be found in the product description, so please double-check before placing your order!",1

"The stockings had a strong but hard-to-define odor when I opened the packaging. For want of a better word, I'll say ""musty"", but that doesn't truly describe it.  It was offensive, but not as bad as that word might conjure up.  The box said they were made in El Salvador.  I washed them, but they still exuded an odor, so I aired them for several days before stowing them.  When I finally decided to try them on, they still smelled strange, only now it was coming from me!  They didn't feel like the same material of my other Sheer Energy stockings that I bought long ago.  The new ones felt looser in the ankles and tighter near the top of the thighs, even though I am lean (and my older pairs feel fine).  After a few minutes of wearing the new ones, my legs started to itch all over, so I ditched them.  I don't want to wear them and would not recommend them to anyone.",1

"These are not the K-Swiss's I'm used to. The classics that I love have always been soooooo soft and comfortable. I just can't find them in stores anymore.

I also fit into a boys size and these feel like the boys classics. Same look, but different amount of cushioning and slightly wide. These shoes are also stiffer than the K-Swiss's I'm used to. I would not recommend to anyone.",1
"Well, I knew it would happen sooner or later -- buying watches online is always a bit of a risk, and thus far I've been very pleased, but this Citizen misses the mark, and does so, by a long shot.I got it, because of the Eco Drive.  With more than a few watches now, I tire of changing batteries, and, while I've gotten into automatics, of late, it means adding a winder to the purchase cost, and finding a place to put said winder.  Eco Drive is the best of all worlds -- never runs out of gas, and just light keeps it happy, and will survive the Zombie Apocalypse!Let me first say I purchased this watch elsewhere, for just under $200, and frankly, now that I have received it, it's really only worth maybe half of that price.  It just does not have the fit, finish, or feel of other Citizen watches, let alone options that could be had for the $300+ for which it is listed here.  For that price, you could be into a true Swiss watch, such as a Victorinox, even a Tissot or Wenger, or frankly an Invicta would even be a better option for those seeking a good watch despite lack of brand bragging rights (for those to whom such even matters).The complaints:Bezel.  As many others have noted, the bezel is loose, so much so that it rattles when you touch the watch.  Based on this being a common theme in reviews here, it appears it was made this way, for whatever reason, but it feels like it's going to fall off.  I'm sure it won't, but the floppy clicks around the dial just feel lousy, not to mention it doesn't line up exactly at the 12 o'clock position.  So, the bezel is a minus.The shiny strap.  A big minus.  It is too small, too stiff, and smells like paint -- no doubt because of the fake croco design that seems painted on the surface.  Oh, and the spacing of the notches are such that it's a choice between a bit too loose or a bit too tight, neither of which makes for happy wearing.  They should have gone with a supple true leather, without the embarrassing effort at fake croc.It doesn't help that the words ""Band China"" are emblazoned on the inside of the strap either.  I mean, it already feels like cheap junk from a sweat shop, and advertising it just makes it all feel worse somehow...and diminishes the sense of having bought a Citizen watch from the famed Citizen company of Japan.  I know everyone sources parts from China, but most brands don't go around advertising it -- especially not in big letters right on the watch somewhere.Plus the pins are clanky, and it feels like the strap may pop off the case if the wrong direction of pressure is exerted.The impossible functions.  Just ridiculous!  I have never encountered a complication where, to engage anything, you have to pull out the crown.  Stuffed, as it is, between two crown guards, you can't even get to the crown decently without taking the watch off, fighting the Strap From Hell to do so.  Trying to engage it, on your wrist, is very frustrating.  So, you don't have an easy access chronograph -- because you can't just hit the top pusher, like almost any other chrono, you instead have to pull out the crown, not fully mind you (and the loose crown makes a precise click outward rather difficult) then rotate the crown to the ""CHR"" marker on the little dial down by six o'clock.  WHY?!?!?!Added to that issue, is that the bottom pusher doesn't reset the chronograph. So, you can't do an elapsed time stop, with the timer still running, to perform any kind of ""split time"" event.  Thus, NOT even a true chronograph!  Oh, and the tenths of a second dial doesn't report in, when you stop the counter with the top pusher -- nope, have to use the bottom pusher, hold it in, and then it will tell you what the tenths of seconds dial indicates.  Then, hold the top pusher to reset.  I've never encountered such a primitive version of a chrono.Obviously, the ""oh wait, let me get my watch ready first"" feature makes any effort to quickly time an event to be a complete joke, as you have to first ""prep"" the watch to even get it into chronograph mode and, minus a split time ability, it seems Citizen could have just left it off of the watch completely, or advertised that it is not a true timer for what is most often standard on any watch with a chronograph function.Functions.  The functions themselves are WAY TOO complicated.  Besides the chrono, anything else also has to be accessed by pulling out the crown.  Reminds me of an old computer where it took ten steps to do what now is a single mouse click effort.  So, the alarm and second time zone both also require you to access the ""menu"" dial of the watch, which for some reason repeats everything on the right, and the left side of the ""menu"" dial.  Pointless, and makes you think the left side does something different than the right, which seems not to be the case.  It's just the same functions, repeated.It's like they got to that stage and thought, oh, shoot, what do we do with this extra dial space, since it only does four things??  I know, we'll repeat those things so it looks like the watch does more than it does!And, just the hassle of going into the ""menu"" and trying to remember what sequence of buttons does what makes the whole thing just irritating.  It can be figured out, and there are downloadable instructions plus some videos out there, but, it just seems entirely unnecessary to have made this so overly complex and the fact that none of it is easily navigated while actually wearing the watch is very poorly planned.Lume.  A joke!  Are you kidding me Citizen??  My Citizen AT World Chronograph lights up like the moon at night, but the lume they used here is just pathetic!  Barely glows after directly charging it, and fades within minutes.  Terrible.Alarm noise is USELESS.  So, even if you want to spend twenty minutes setting the alarm, you won't hear it, because the beep is so quiet it wouldn't wake even a fussy newborn if you had it nestled right next to her ear, let alone a slumbering adult, with the watch over on a nightstand.  Why bother adding an alarm, if you're going to install a whisper quiet chime???So, basically this is a fail in every capacity.  One might be happy that it at least tells the time, but, thus far, it seems not to hold a charge as well as my other Citizen Eco Drive, meaning it likes to default to ""power save"" mode, even if under a long shirt sleeve, so even merely as a watch it struggles to score points.Is there ANYTHING to like?  Well, not really.  I mean, it looks nice, in the box, but it fits awkwardly, and as soon as you attempt to use any of what it supposedly offers, the little bit of good looks fails to hold frustrations at bay.If you DO like the style of it, consider this option:Wenger Men's Squadron Chrono Watch with Leather BraceletI will note that it is $100 LESS than this dud, and, along with those savings, it brings you:Swiss Made Quartz movement (true Swiss, so it come with the heritage and prestige of such), Sapphire crystal, soft leather strap, brilliantly epic lume, incredible bezel, real chrono with split time and just oozes quality in all aspects.  I own it (see my review for details) and I LOVE IT.It only has 100m water resistance (still more than sufficient for most -- that's 330 feet, plenty for most recreational needs), as opposed to this one here with 200m, but with the useless lume on this watch, you wouldn't be able to see it under ten feet of water, let alone six hundred.  The Wenger doesn't have an alarm, but this one is worthless anyway, and, although the Wenger also doesn't have a second time zone, there are far better GMT watches that can be had for less than what is being charged for this model -- plus, again, it takes going into the ""menu"" to even access the other time zone here, so, again, it just doesn't do what it says it does., or doesn't do it well, certainly.If it's the Eco Drive you wanted, plus the full feature set that is supposed to be found here, I'd say definitely keep looking.  I note that this same internal engine set up is even on much higher priced Citizen models, so it seems you have to look carefully, model by model, to avoid this same mess.  If you are dedicated to solar power, Seiko has some decent options, although, as with Citizen, it seems this is one of the few options in a leather strap, but, then too, this strap is awful...So, in summary, if you like what this watch pretends to offer, you won't find it here and, although it may take some searching to find a leather strap, solar powered watch with a bezel, a second time zone, alarm and chronograph, keep in mind that you really are NOT finding it in this watch, so, even if you have to lose one of those features, it's worth it, to get a watch that actually does what it claims.This doesn't put me off Citizen -- the World Time AT Chrono I have is, rightfully so, a watch with worldwide recognition, and I love it, beyond a doubt, one of my best, but this is a BIG MISS by this company, and hopefully these wrongs will be righted in future models, because I do like what they are trying to achieve with this one, but they just haven't done it.SUMMARY:No star for function -- has a myriad of functionality issuesNo star for fitment -- poor strap, poor bezel, poor lume, feels like a ten dollar watchNo star for value -- very much overpriced for what it fails to provideNo star for recommendation -- would not recommend it, would not buy it againOne star because I have to have one star for review, and because this does come from a good brand, so I have hope this debacle will be sorted out in future renditionsI hope this has been helpful.

"I have a small head for the average man (Im 5'-7"" and 155 pounds). This was labeled as an adult hat so I purchased it for Halloween. It doesn't even come close to fitting on my head! Also, it is incredibly hard and rigid so there was no way for me to coax it to conform to my head. I urge to to read the reviews (which I didn't), note the internal measurements, and measure your head first before purchasing. One person answered the question about size as '7-1/4"" across 8-1/4"" front to back with an inside depth of 6-1/4"" '. I would urge the manufacturer to put these measurements in the product description.",1

"These are FAKE Jack Rogers! I am so disappointed with Amazon, when I purchased these I just put them in my closet to wait till spring to wear them. Then I pulled them out today to start breaking them in and I noticed it says ""Made In Dominican Republic"" jacks are Always made in the USA. After comparing them to my authentic jacks (the platinum one in the picture) I noticed several  inconsistencies with thes shoes. The circles are further apart on the leather (not genuine on these fakes from Amazon) and on the sole, the shape of the show is slightly different, and the stitching is different lengths and there is a different material used for the sole stitching. I have passed the one month return policy for Amazon so I can no longer return the show. So dissapointed, I will not be purchasing shoes from Amazon ever again and now I will always read the reviews before I purchase from Amazon since they have now lost my trust. (The white shoes are the Amazon fakes and the platinum is genuine from jacks website)",0

"I really liked these boots when I first got them but was let down after a month of wear. The wood on the bottom is only a thin layer, like a thin sticker with rubber underneath. My problem was that this wood started to crack, peel, and chip away within a month of ownership. The sides literally have chunks missing and you can see the black rubber underneath- it looks very cheap and tarnishes an otherwise perfect product. On the right foot, the back wood sticker is literally splintering and peeling away in the middle and peeling upwards from the bottom. This is the spot I plant my foot into the carpet in my car and pivot left/right to switch between gas pedal and break. I checked the carpet and it's clean with no rocks in it. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells to avoid further damage to the wood stickers and trying to figure out if there is a way to replace them. I should mention that I haven't worn these in any snowy weather or strangely wet conditions; I've worn them in gentle rain two or three times, don't do any considerable walking outdoors, and don't go anywhere that requires me to trod through puddles. I really don't know why this is happening but it's occurring to both heels.Other than that one problem I do like the boots. The leather seems to be great quality after a month. It's durable and prevents scratching. I still don't have a scratch on them. They look amazing when you first get them before the fake wood heel self-destructs. It's just annoying to pay for something in this price bracket and have it let you down so quickly. I would never buy another pair of these with the fake wood heel again, only solid block in the future.",0

"BEWARE  DON'T BUY A CASIO - IF AN ALARM IS A IMPORTANT FEATURE  (any ""alarm"" watch, in particular a Casio Men's ""W201-1AV Alarm Chronograph"" - the exact name on Amazon's site for the watch I purchased).  Note the name ""Alarm Chronogragh"":  it could not be a more specific designation associated with purpose and function.WHY:  Casio Men's w201-1AV Alarm Chronograph's alarm is allegedly inaudible due to its frequency for certain people according to Casio.  And they expressly stated their alarms all have the same frequency proprietarily between 1- 6000 hertz.  I'm guessing that is the range of possible human hearing.  Why they would not divulge that specific frequency is a mystery - as any audiometer or frequency measuring device could detect a frequency so there is no ""trade secret"" type reason for preventing such a disclosure.I had initially thought I had set the alarm incorrectly - I may have done it wrong - so asked my neighbor who is a watch collector to set and test the alarm, and no alarm.  His sister did it too - no audible alarm.I then called Casio well before the warranty expired (I'd worn the watch for less than 24 hours total) - the Casio rep on the phone had me do an alarm test set and I held the watch 1"" from the receiver - she heard no sound and once again I did not.  When she could not hear it she authorized repairs.  At my expense I sent the watch to ""TIME MACHINE"", Casio's authorized repair center.  TIME MACHINE sent the watch back with a invoice which is too faint to be reproducible which stated nothing was wrong with the alarm or watch.  Be that as it may, when I sent this watch to Casio's repair service ""TIME MACHINE"" a total of four people could not hear the alarm prior to sending it.But TIME MACHINE's rep (""Abel"") called before sending the watch back and left a voice message:  that ""certain people"" can't hear the alarm frequency.  Neither myself or my neighbors have hearing problems - none of us wear a hearing aid.I called both Casio and the TIME MACHINE and complained that such a situation was ludicrous.  I was told to send the watch back to the TIME MACHINE and they would act as a liaison and assist me in getting a replacement.  Sent the watch back on my dime again.I have never had a problem with an alarm watch before.  I paid about half the value in postage. Casio has refused to replace the watch -  Casio is knowingly selling ""alarm"" watches - advertising that particular feature - to people who have no hearing known hearing problems but for the ""proprietary"" and un-disclosable frequency Casio uses for its alarms.  Selling them to people who will not be able to hear the alarm with no warning or disclaimer associated with the advertising.A lot of hassle for a $12 watch.  And they're sending back the same unit that can not be heard.  A not so quality response from what I thought was a quality company.What a sham!!  Shame on Casio.  BEWARE10.24.14  UPDATE (on 10.20.14 review above):TIME MACHINE sent watch back ""Signature Requested"" - strange thing for a $12 watch with taping stating a warning to inspect contents if seal is broken.  That is rare for a $12 watch.  I happen to be a former attorney who got sanctions against an alleged FBI agent.  I have lived an electronic ""Alice in Wonderland"" electronic life ever since.  I could be regarded as a whistle blower.NOTE Casio's blurb under their product description for this watch at Amazon:""Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.""Ask yourself if watches can be radio controlled why not the alarm function?  And if the FBI / NSA is or can be monitoring non internet connected stand alone on-line computers remotely via electromagnetic radiation (eg. radio waves) why not ""watches"" and their alarm functions.  And if Microsoft Google and major telecommunications companies reluctantly and on a delayed basis have admitted being in the bed of intrusive technology with the FBI / NSA, why not Casio either wittingly or unwittinglyThe real issue in this review is that ""certain people"" cannot hear a Casio alarm with a specified proprietary frequency that is supposedly in the human hearing frequency range but Casio refuses to disclose that frequency presumably (the only apparent logical assumption) on some type of trade secret proprietary basis.  Yet that is something that could be easily and precisely detected by fairly inexpensive instruments.  Something does not add up.  Perhaps 2 + 2 is really 5 (referencing Orwell's  ""1984"")This comment is appropriate to the Amazon review because Casio's reps said that ""others"" have problems hearing their unidentified watch alarm frequency (which they stated was the same for, and common to, all their alarm watches) - not just the folks I cited above directly involved with me who have no apparent or known hearing defects.What a sham!!  Shame on Casio.  BEWARE",1

Authentic TOMS would never have glue hanging out like that.  Third, the stitching was wide, uneven and coming apart.  Finally, if you look inside the shoe where your heel should lie, it says TOMS with a  sign following, real TOMS have TOMS and the  sign following.  These are clearly fake and Amazon has accepted my request to return.  It baffles me as to how this seller is allowed to continue selling these fakes to thousands of people and Amazon is is doing nothing to stop it.",0

"Boot looks nice.- Mine don't have the smokey black tones as pictured.  It may vary by boot.Fits as expected- I suspect people that are saying theirs didn't fit is due to them comparing what they wear in sneakers.  I based my size off of measuring my foot with a ruler, and then going by what google says to get.  I wear 1.5 sizes  bigger in my sneakers.- While the foot is good, the shin part is way too wide.  On top of this, the inside has a fabric that isn't very soft.  Other boots will usually have a softer material for comfort.  This will be fine as long as you wear longer socks; at least up to mid-calf.Material is ok- Leather feels and smells like fake leather.  It's either fake, or closer to the leather they use to make footballs.- FYI, it says ""Leather Upper.  All other materials man-made.""In summary, these are not a great bargain at $100.  They are at most worth $100.  You would be able to find an equivalent boot for cheaper during sales events.I'll be sending mine back if I can, or giving them to Goodwill.",0

No arch support makes these shoes terrible for wearing for long periods of time. Sizing is also inconsistent. The left shoe fit perfectly while the right was too long.,1
Ordered size 4-6x based on ratings claiming this runs small. My daughter has been wearing 4t. This was entirely too big. More like 6x or bigger. The hat is a joke. Brim was all bent up and the crown of the hat is shaped like a square. A very shallow square that absolutely will not stay on a small child's head.,1

"This is a very pretty watch but it does not keep time. Initially it did for about half a year, than it stopped, I had the battery replaced, then it only worked sparodically, keeping time for a few hours to a few days at a time accurately before it slows down or stops entirely requiring the time to be re-set & it'll re-run again; so I replaced the battery a 2nd time thinking it may be a faulty battery & the same thing happens.

I purchased this bag a year ago for my wife. She used it six months later on our trip to Italy. The bag performed well on the trip but when we returned home I noticed that the stitching that holds the bottom to the bag was slightly frayed but did not look it would cause a problem. Gosh was I wrong. We went on another trip to Oregon and when we arrived at the Portland airport baggage claim I saw the the bottom of the bag was open and that the zipper teeth had separated from the zipper backing and the contents were exposed. Luckily nothing was lost. I sewed the zipper shut for the return trip home. We shipped the bag back to High Sierra and they immediately sent us a replacement which was a flimsey and cheaper version of the bag we had. When I unpacked it I saw that the top zipper to the entry for the bag was already unraveled and defective. I called High Sierra and they sent another of the cheaper bags but I have no confidence that the bag will last any longer than it's predecessor because it has the same zippers and the same flawed design.,1

"Purchased these in October of 2014 and I'm ready to throw them out. While they are comfortable in general, I have two issues. The outer sole or tread if you will is not durable and is wearing out. The biggest problem is the foot bed is covered with some material that does not appear to be leather. It attracts dirt and leaves which stick to the stuff requiring me to take the sandals off and scrape the debris out. On true leather sandals debris such as small twigs, stones and bits of leaf will just fall out. Recently I've noticed the fake leather material is lifting away from the foot bed, becoming loose and clumping. Clarks that I've owned in the past have been very durable and held up for several years but not these.",0

"This bag is a fake. I ordered it in the yellow color and it arrived. The fabric felt cheap and the color didn't match other pictures. There were a few threads loose and the cut on the seat pad was very rough. I examined the logo and the zippers and the tags-- they all matched what the real Kanken exactly. But I took it to the Fjallraven store and compared it to their real bag. The fabric on real bag felt thicker and more durable. The color was also richer and more vibrant. The quality of the stitching was much better. The real one felt like a good bag for the price. The bag I bought on amazon was obviously a fake when compared to the original kanken. If you order a Kanken and it feels cheap, it is most likely a fake. Order your Kanken on the fjallraven website, on Nordstroms, or go to a Fjallraven store. I love my genuine Kanken. It fits everything (the 11.9 inch iPad Pro, headphones, a book, a jacket, a water bottle, a sketchbook and some pens, and more) and is comfortable to wear. The yellow colored bag does get dirty simply because it is a light color. I have yet to clean it but at the Fjallraven store they said it can be easily cleaned using Mr Clean magic erasers (which are found on amazon). It is sturdy, surviving numerous airport trips. Overall a great bag when bought from a trusted source (I give the genuine bag five stars). It is worth returning the fake bag (one star) and spending the money on a genuine Kanken.",0

"Believe all the warnings. There are a lot of fake watches being sold out there. 1. If you see your delivery is being directly shipped from Hong Kong - CANCEL IT. 2. The second easiest test is hold the watch under a bright light and then bring it into a dark room. Fake watches will not illuminate as well as the real thing. They should be bright and every number should light up bright. If they do not, RETURN IT. 3. They claim they all come with printed materials just like the real thing. The printed materials are never printed as nicely as the real thing-the photos are usually blown out because they are printed from coping the real thing and not from original art. If you question the authenticity of the printed materials the accompany the watch, RETURN IT. They will usually take it right back because they know they sold you a fake! I have real Tissot Watches and love them.",0

I'm not sure if the quality just isn't up to par, or if they would be in better condition if I didn't have to stretch them so much over my thighs and butt!I can't decide if I'll try to size up and give DKNY another shot, or if I should just try another brand altogether.",1
"I've had a pair of these in the past and they were much better built. Either Dockers have now compromised on their materials and/or process, or these are fake Dockers... My purchase fairly quickly split across the bottom between the heel and sole.  Around the sides of the heel, the rubber also began to peel away in layers. It seemed like there was an older heel underneath (?), and that the shoe had been somehow refurbished.  Perhaps ill-moulded parts were later corrected to make sub-standard stock, ""good"".  While my uppers have lasted, as others have commented, unlike earlier models, this line now uses more leather pieces (scraps/cutt offs) to make the upper of the shoe.  I didn't have a problem with the fact the upper utilizes smaller pieces of leather stitched together. The design still looked nice to me. and the the stitching of these pieces has held up.  However, this is no consolation, given that the rubber soles have fallen apart.  I made this purchase based on my previous good experience of the same shoe I had purchased from DSW. It's been disappointing to discover that for whatever reason (slipping standards/'knock-off'), that I will likely now not by another Dockers shoe.",0

The quest for a bra with truly humane shoulder straps continues.  Like Goldilocks I tried the first one-too big. Went down 2 sizes (following the manufacturer's size guidelines) - too small .  Went up one size - too large in some places too small in others.  Having to deal with so many snaps - it's work! - would be worth it if fit was acceptable.,1

"Out of the box, these slippers are pretty much among the worst things I've ever put my feet into. And I once stepped barefoot into dog poop.First of all, they reek. It smells like play-dough, not like new shoe. I like new shoe smell. It's a good smell, it's a nostalgic smell.  Play-dough? On my feet? Not so much. They're moderately soft, which I can live with. But really, slippers should be like putting your feet into clouds. They're for relaxing, taking a load off. If I wanted support I'd wear my shoes. I want something I can wear around the house, indoors and out, and imagine I'm on sunshine. These are more like I'm on the moon. Don't get me wrong, I like the moon, it rules, but definitely not what I was expecting. They just don't feel like a slipper. They feel more like a furry shoe. Could be a positive if you're into that sorta thing.But really, those are the least of my qualms. The reason these slippers are so horrible is that the stitching on the inside is sub par. Strike that, it's sub sub par. It's so sub par it's almost circled around and become above par. The elastic binding the top to the sides just sticks out there, scratching the tops of your feet. It's really quite uncomfortable, and a little disconcerting. Here's an idea for the manufacturer: PUT THE ELASTIC BEHIND THE FAKE FUR. Really, it's not that hard a concept. I want my foot in fluffy dammit! How am I supposed to enjoy fake fluffy if I've got hard, scratchy elastic rubbing against my feet?Who knows, maybe they'll break in. I'm willing to give these slippers the benefit of the doubt. That's why I'm giving them two stars instead of one. I bought them on sale for $10 so I'm not gonna cry over spilled milk. If they were $25 slippers I'd demand my money back. That's the sorta level of slipper where you expect, nay, demand quality. These? I'm a bit just disappointed mostly. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I've been psyching myself up for slippers too much. I really wanted to treat myself to a pair. After going barefoot in the house for so long, I feel like I deserved something. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I haven't worn slippers since I was 10, and those were gorilla slippers. And let me tell you, gorilla slippers... well... there's your life pre-gorilla-slippers and your life post-gorilla-slippers. Maybe they set the bar too high... but I don't really think so. Honestly, I think these are just crappy slippers.Maybe I'll take some play-dough and round off the edges of the elastic. Or maybe I'll just hope they scratch my feet, infect them, and then I'll start a class-action lawsuit against the manufacturer. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I had tried these slippers on in the store, I would have passed on them. You might wanna consider that too, unless you like scratched play-dough feet. I don't judge.",0

"it is not what I expected from a Skagen.  The casing is very thick and looks like a cheap imitation. Not to mention the watch arrived with a broken stem so I can't set the time.  It was a real disappointment.The reason I wanted to purchase another Skagen watch when my band broke on my other watch, is that I liked the look. Unfortunately, I was told by several jewelers whom I asked about fixing the watch that it would cost me about the price of a new one to fix the old b/c Skagen sold the company and the new owners have TERRIBLE customer service.In short, this watch is not what I had hoped for.  There is nothing unique or interesting about it.  The key feature, for me, that commends the Skagen brand is its thin, sleek casing.  Clearly that is no longer the case, at least not with this particular model.  Not sure if they no longer manufacture that line anymore.  But absent the sleek look, I will select another brand and one that I know I can service without hassle.  I was willing to take the risk with Skagen, but now after seeing the watch I don't want to go this route and will select another brand that appeals to me, and one whose manufacturer stands 100% behind their brand and their product.

"The zipper on my Kipling Lancelot Flap Shoulder Bag broke after five years of daily use. Replacing the zipper would have cost almost as much as replacing the purse, so I decided to buy a complete replacement.When the replacement came, I discovered it was missing an inner pocket that also divided the snap pouch into two areas! I carry my tablet and Kindle with me everywhere, and I always stow my gadgets behind this inner pocket. I also bring a variety of gift cards and other small tchotchkes such as headphones or validated parking receipts. The new Kipling Lancelot has no space for these items!Furthermore, the new Kipling Lancelot does not have the two little pen pockets. They moved the pen pocket to set between to larger pockets. Now my phone no longer fits in the pocket I usually carry it in!It's unacceptable. The manufacturing standards were obviously dropped to make the newer version of this Kipling purse.The 420 Denier Nylon used to make the purse is darn near indestructible. I've been a big Kipling fan for over ten years, but this is a big blow in my confidence of the brand. I've returned my Kipling Lancelot bag, and I have no idea what I'm going to do to replace my old one.",1
"Good:  Product is cheap and will work OK provided your pins are not stubborn or long.Bad: Picture provided in product description highlights that ""Color doesn't make a difference, thickness of the plastic does!""Well, the product that I received was the thin flimsy one depicted as ""Standard Duty"".  Not the nicer Heavy-Duty one.I specifically chose this item/vendor because it was advertised as being higher quality.  Nope.  Same thin cheap plastic as all the others.

"I purchased a black pair and a chestnut pair over a year ago. For those ordering online, I can't imagine what you will receive.One color will have sheepskin lining on the upper boot but, manmade materials on the bottom. Others have manmade materials in all the boot. Others reversed - sheepskin on the bottom but the rest of the boot will be plastic. Frustrating!!The boots are comfortable but, they won't last long. The soles fall apart and crack very soon after purchase. If you are looking for something to wear around the house or in the office and don't plan on going outside - go for it. The limited wear will help you keep them longer.If you are lucky and get the sheepskin interior - you won't have the sweat and odor worries associated with the fake lined boots and shoes.",0

"Ordered this ring and a different diamond ring because of price, color and clarity. It all seemed to be a great deal, but when I received the rings the clarity of the diamonds were not want I was expecting. Both in the title and in the product description the company has SI-I.  Well I thought maybe a few diamonds might not be SI clartiy, but DONE of the diamonds were SI clarity. The diamonds were of the LOWER end of I(imperfect).  They were cloudy and not shiny at all.  I called the company Diamond Delight and they agreed that there was a big difference between SI and I. And that they could not offer me the rings with SI clarity diamonds. They said that they did not understand and had been working with Amazon to list the rings with a better and true discription. Well, it has now been 2 weeks and the information still is the SI-I clarity.  When I look at other companies that sell diamond rings on Amazon they seem not to have a problem, they have either SI,I1, I2 or I3 clarity. I'm not sure why Diamond Delight is having a problem????  I would have paid more for cleaner diamonds if the price was fair. *** to there credit they did let me return the rings free of charge back to them, because they said it was an error on them.***",1
"For the price I would expect better quality and design. The material is paper thin, the shirt is wait to short, it can't even tuck into my pants.  The belt design stops at the side of the outfit, it doesn't go all the way around the waist and the belt doesn't stay shut...it keeps slipping out of the poorly made belt buckle. The buckle is made out of thin cheap plastic, like something from a dollar store. And the hair attached to the head piece looks nothing like what's in the picture, it was so fake and frazzled looking and it wasn't the same color as shown.",0

"While this backpack has all the trademark quality one expects of a Jansport, it's not up to snuff on the size side of things.  The product description makes it sound larger than it is.  We could not fit the things into this backpack my 5th grader needs, much less the list given in the description.  This pack should be okay for early elementary, perhaps up to 3rd grade.  Parent's don't plan on being able to fit more than a binder and a couple notebooks in here.Seller: Save yourself the hassle of a return to a third party vendor who won't adequately reimburse you for return postage and just buy the traditional Jansport with the leather bottom.  The cheapest postage to return this from Atlanta was ~$14, not the $4-5 suggested by the retailer.  This has something to do with their address being a business address.",1

"I received these boots today and they weren't authentic Emu Australia boots. I contacted Emu Australia to verify this before I sent them back, but it was obvious the moment I opened the box.  Why?  Here's a list:They looked gray, rather than chocolate brown.The insoles weren't removable.The soles were 1/2"" thinner than my old, worn out Emus, which should have been identical.The ""Emu"" on the bottom looked totally different than my old pair.No metal ""Emu"" tag dangling from the side!!The back ""Emu"" was leather, not metal.The length of the boots were about 1/2"" shorter than my old boots (same size - 7M)The width of the boots were at least 1/4"" of an inch smaller.They were also falsely advertised on the Amazon website. The boots shown were Stinger Platinum and after speaking to a representative from Emu Australia's US store, they said that all Platinum Stingers should have removable insoles and these were either fakes or extremely old stock being sold at current prices.  If you select ""chocolate brown"" in size 7, you can see which seller I got these from.I am going to attempt to upload some photos from my phone so you can see the comparison.",0
I wrote to the company and they never bothered to acknowledge the problem.,0
I can't believe how stiff this shirt is.  We've washed it three times and it can still stand up on it's own.  Why?  It's hard to believe it's even cotton.Update: After 4 washings in fabric softener it's only slightly better.  I tried ironing is and the iron makes some parts shiny. That means it's probably NOT cotton.  Don't buy this if you want a comfortable shirt.  Reducing to one star because now I can't even return it.  I've contacted Wrangler because I think this is a fake.,0

"The shoe fit perfectly, looks great, and feels great - but within one week, I noticed the fabric around one of the lace ringlets starting to tear. I have probably worn the shoe less than 7 or 8 times and its already tearing? I think that is highly unacceptable.",1
"Quite frankly, they're not worth the cost.  My son needed this particular brand and color for a school play.  We had to get them a size and a half big, so if you're in between order up a size (or maybe order up anyways).  They seem quite narrow.  There's no arch support.They're basically what shoes were 40 years ago, canvas upper - not much support and flat, flat, flat sole - no arch and not even good traction.  I gave it a 2, since there's not specifically anything wrong with them.  Not sure why these have become popular again.  A hula hoop seems a more cost effective way of being nostalgic",1

Unfortunately it did NOT come with the hat (as ordered) AND the both the fabric (sleazy) and the workmanship were poor!  It's a good thing I can sew becaue I had to reconstruct (yes, ""reconstruct"" - not simply mend!) the entire costume!  The seam of one sleeve was frayed open from underarm to cuff; the other from midsleeve up and then down the side to the waist.  One cuff was open by about an inch; the other attached only by about half an inch!  It was most disappointing!  We would have been willing to pay a little more for something that was actually well-made and could be enjoyed!

"Well gee, I guess I'm not a Genius, Artist, or an Innovator (or a ""G.A.I."" as stated in the oh-so-""clever"" and not at all condescending product description) as the ViewSlimmy wallet was completely useless to me for day to day activities.  I take it that G.A.I.s don't have a need for such bourgeois items as an auto-club card, driver's license, health insurance card, security card/badge, library card (I guess G.A.I.s don't read), etc.Long story short: I wanted a wallet with an external ID window so I could easily display and access my security ID without removing it from my wallet.  I don't like wearing my ID around my neck or dangling from my wrist; but I need it on me at all times in my high security work environment. I bought this wallet with high expectations, but immediately had to return it as it would not hold even half of the items I need on a day to day basis.  Also, and perhaps more importantly, while the materials were good I found the stitching/construction to be sub-standard at best.So, all you G.A.I.s that fall for condescending sales pitches and don't need to carry much in your wallets (assuming you can scrape together the cash as this wallet is WAY overpriced), you will be very happy with this product.  You can show it off to your other G.A.I. friends and have a good laugh at the non-G.A.I. people like me that just couldn't handle the challenge of switching to the ViewSlimmy wallet.",1
"Authentic or fake, I don't know; but I can definitely say the New Wayfarers I bought from Sunglass Express are of lower quality than the pair I bought in 2011.Yes, the frames squeak and creak. Even though polarized, the light green G-15 lenses offer little protection from the sunshine. I found myself squinting through my $120 Ray-Bans. That's bogus. I was almost tempted to pop out the lenses and make sure they weren't polycarbonate plastic instead of the crystal green (glass) lenses I had been promised.Strangely enough, the RB2132 Ray-Ban New Wayfarer I bought from Sunglass Express is almost a carbon-copy of the $39.99 Kirkland Abruzzo frame offered by Costco. The only difference between the two is that the Ray-Ban front is flat across, and the bridge of the Kirkland frame is raised.I returned my RB2132s to Sunglass Express. I kept the Costco frames.",0

Two days later I went to put them on to wear with the dress I was going to wear to go out, and found that there was a big hole in the back part of one foot.  It must have happened in taking them off when I tried them on, but I wasn't aware of anything having happened.  I had to put makeup on my legs and go bare legged.  Not a happy camper.

I have this watch and it is great for exercise and general use.  I had an old ironman watch for the longest time.  I lifeguarded for four summers with  it and wore it every time I went swimming.  I used it to count laps while I was swimming.  After 6 years it finally died and I got this one.  I'm disappointed because the first time I wore it in the water it stopped working.  Eventually it started working again when it dried out.  The seal on it must not be any good.  I only give it two stars because it hasn't lived up to the expectations I had for it based on my old ironman watch.,1

I purchased thesw Warrior RB3342 Sunglasses. The product description indicated that they were Polarized and the Color code was 004/58. The glasses I received were not polarized (no polarized code etched on the lens) and the color code was not 004/58 they were 004. I am truly dissapointed.,1
The strap is not affixed at the correct spot so it will flip over and everything will fall out. I modified it so the strap attaches at a balanced location. It is true that your cards can fall out the side. I addressed this by putting more than one card in a slot and leaving the slot closest to the edge empty. I use it but probably won't for very long.,1
Very pretty stones fall out easily. Exchanged the first set I got for new and stones were missing when I got the second set. Also had some kind of white stuff all over it . looked like glue. Waiting still for a refund and its been a couple months . would not recommend,0
"I buy several color pair of timbs during this time a year and I just didn't find my size in wheats at the outlet store. I ideally go straight to timbs website but I was shopping for someone on amazon and decided to search timbs. I saw the reviews on here and thought I could trust the purchase. As soon as I took them out I knew they were fakes. The stitching is coming loose and the fabric is barely holding together. Their is random glue all over the place to wear even if I tried to wear it you could see. The tree stamp on both shows don't really match in color. The glue line that holds the material to the sole is thick in most areas and in other a line that looks like it was erased. So the suede is darker. See in the pic where the laces go through, the fabric seems to already be coming apart. I just received these today and have not worn. If I wear these I'm certain they will fall apart. I have included pics, hope this helps. Now I have to return these and order directly from timberland. '",0
"I was very mislead by the description of this watch. I searched Amazon for ""Casio watch stainless steel"" and I found this watch. I carefully read the description, which, as of today, 5/19/2015, reads exactly as follows (a direct copy and paste), parenthetical statements mine:""Made in USA or Imported (OK - which one?)Stainless steel watch featuring link bracelet and rectangular dial window with digital display and stopwatch (No, the watch is not stainless, it is PLASTIC. The BAND and case back are stainless. On the back, it clearly says ""Stainless steel back"" which in watch-speak means the case, or bezel, is ""other"". The case looks like polished stainless in the pictures, but look at it in person - it is shiny like the ""chrome"" pieces in a model airplane, and very, very light weight. PLASTIC.)Quartz movementMineral crystal dial window (NO IT IS NOT. It is acrylic. You can scratch it very, very easily)Features fold-over clasp closure, alarm, and luminosityWater-resistant to 99 feet (30 M): withstands rain and splashes of water, but not showering or submersion""I don't expect a G-Shock for $14, but a simple, retro all-stainless Casio watch? Possibly. That is not the case with this watch. The description should match the product. This experience makes me doubt any product description on Amazon, reinforced by an experience about a month ago where a G-Shock I purchased as a gift for my nephew was described as having a compass, but it did not have a compass. Two strikes.All of that said, I am sure it would keep time just fine, it just is absolutely NOT what it is described as being.",1

"First of all, I wasn't aware this was even legal in most townships/municipalities/counties. I had an amazon driver drive through our property tonight at 10:30pm with his headlights off and just his orange parking lights on. I only noticed him because of the flashlight he was shining that was incidentally coming through our windows from his vehicle while the driver was trying to locate the house number. We live at the end of a private lane, the length of a football field, in a heavily wooded area.Obviously, knowing that my neighbors wouldn't be snooping on my property with flashlights and their car running with its lights off, I grabbed a baseball bat and ran downstairs and out the front door. The driver had dropped someone else's package on my front door and saw that I had come outside. He started to drive away until I put the bat down and started waving and holding the package in the air. He eventually felt confident enough I wasn't going to beat him and returned and got the package back from me to take to the right house.Long story short, I sincerely hope these covert, late-night delivery tactics weren't actually approved and communicated by Amazon, because it will undoubtedly wind up with someone getting seriously hurt eventually.",0
"I have an old Timex watch with a silver band and I love it for it's ease of wear, easily slipping on and off and its comfort. I also love it because it is very easy to read.

"Merrill makes a great shoe, can't argue that. However, these shoes when delivered were grey rather than black and the fit is small. I'm an 8 1/2 in all other Merrills, but these fit like an 8. I will be donating them to a coworker and will make future purchases in store only.",1
"I LOVE Merrell shoes and over the last 6 years or so I've owned like 10 pairs, mostly in the Bare Access or Road Glove line.  I love how light those shoes are and how wide the toe box is.  I always bought size 12 and they always fit well.  I wanted some house shoes and saw these here on Amazon on sale so I bought them.  Sadly these were WAY TOO TIGHT AND NARROW in the toebox in my normal size 12.  I couldn't even wear them for like 10 minutes they were so uncomfortable.  I checked the specs to make sure I didn't get a narrow size on accident, and the pair I got as far as I could tell were standard size 12.  So one size 12 is definitely not comparable to another size 12 in Merrells!  I realize that I've been wearing relatively minimalist shoe with a wide toebox so that's what I'm used to, but honestly I was shocked just how poorly these fit.  I returned them and am still looking.  I haven't lost faith in Merrells -- in fact I'm looking for a hiking shoe from them.  But I'm going to have to *go* to a store to try them on I guess.  Bare Access I just order when they go on sale and they fit reliably.  Oh well.  At least Amazon's return policy is awesome!",1

Unfortunately I assumed that the lower price was because the color may be less popular but it appears to be a fake bag. The fabric is thin and crackles.

"I usually do not write negative reviews since I'm a long-time happy Amazon customer. I ordered a size 8 pair of black Toms sold by DirectExpress and fulfilled by Amazon. I am not sure whether the pair I received are fake Toms or if they're defective, but these were far TOO narrow, extremely stiff even though they're supposed to be made of canvas material, and way too small lengthwise. I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe halfway, and neither could my sister or my mom, who both have smaller feet (they're size 6 and 7). The reason I ordered a pair of Toms from Amazon is because I already own a black pair in size 8 that I bought in-store which I find ridiculously comfortable and they're my favorite pair of shoes (keeping in mind I do have wider feet and don't have the easiest time finding the right shoes), but they were falling apart so I wanted to order a replacement. Bad idea...I have to return these. I'm not really sure what went wrong but I'm disappointed and now I need to go through the process of returning them AND making the trip to the store to buy an authentic pair and pay more for it---but I would gladly pay more for authentic quality at this point.",0

Amazon sent it again, to the main USPS facility, different place, that's where my PO box is located, but I used the physical address of the main facility, and specified the box number.  To no avail.  UPS did deliver it, but never got to me, so they (USPS) sent it back to the main UPS facility at MIA (Miami International Airport), which is 2 blocks away, but in terms of Amazon/UPS delivery policies, it's more like a world away.  So I call Amazon back, and talk again with another representative in India, very friendly guy, he tells me he's sorry... you know, the usual stuff, he offers to credit the account and I insist I want the watch, but that they needed to focus on the delivery thing and put the bs aside.I'm not happy now, you know, once, twice, a third time, this is not looking good.",0

 The package came large box ended way short spare .Looks nothing like product photo .,1

"If you have very small wrists, then this  will be great for you.  I took off the rubber watchband and replaced it with this band.  I was not able to get my hand through the band without removing the one end from the supplied clasp.Then, when I fed the band through the clasp, the Velcro would not reach the part that it would attach to.  It just barely missed. I then removed the watchband, threw it in the trash and put the rubber one back on.The rubber one is cheap in quality and I am sure will break soon.  Only buy if you have smaller wrists.  Mine measure 8 inches so if yours are this size or larger, DO NOT BUY!!!!",1
"Shoes were a bit more narrow than expected. They also have more height to them than I thought which isn't good for someone who twist their ankles easily.The most important reason I returned is due to the slickness of the bottoms. The second I stepped outside with these on and walked on a damp surface, my feet went in the air. Now I'm laid up with an iced knee and sprained ankle. Never again.",1
"As I was pulling up the first leg, it tore and I had to throw it out-not a happy camper",1
"I was really excited when I saw this bra online in my size,but unfortunately when the bra came it did not fit like the picture. It was uncomfortable and had absolutely no support....my breast looked like sandwiches",1
elastic too tight on my calves. The buff color is too pale. I was hoping for a color more closer to natural leg color. I will not order these again.,1
Completely broken and falling apart when I got it. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,1
Black pants looked fake. Tag was blank white R mark. No hidden pockets anywhere to be found. Size was inaccurate. I bought a pair in grey and black. Same size and model but black ones were way too small... Grey ones fit correctly and tags actually say Levi's R instead of blank R on the black pair. However both pants were still missing any fifth or hidden pockets as described on Amazon description and Levi's website.,0
The sole fell out as soon as I took it out of the box. Before I even got to try them on!! I believe they were fakes like the other reviews said!,0
"The shoe fits great, but by the smell of them I don't think they are made of real leather. I think they are fakes. I won't order any more Michael kors shoes from this seller. Very disappointed!!",0

"THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL JANSPORT SUPERBREAK BACKPACK!!! This is a fake!

"I have been wearing Sanuk for years and one of the best things about them is they need to break-in time. I have always just put the new ones on and never had a problem. This pair is either defective, irregular or a knock off fake. They hurt from the second I put them on, the straps are not attached correctly they were closer together than others I have. This made them unwearable.",0
Didn't fit and i lost a lot of money paying for shipping both ways after i sent them back.,1
I ordered a women's size 9 for my daughter's xmas gift. She received a size 9 in mens,1
The shoe labeled as black with a picture of a solid black shoe will show up as the Black and White Version. Also these sizes are completely whack. How is a shoe and 8.5 in men's and a 10.5 in women's? Having to return. Whole thing seems sketchy.,1

 Delivery time terrible .I receive 2 week late shoe .,0
Looks like some one has wore them befor me. Soles where clean but came pre laced and has lace marks on the toung for 175$ they should be brand new,0
I do not recommend that you buy them.These shoes look like they are made with super cheap material because they produce bad smell on the feet. My husband had never experienced this with any shoes.,1
My husband is very tall and these pants came down 3in past his knees,1
Too small. Didn't even get them to my knee before they ripped at the waist band.,1
The bra fits well and provides adequate support but the material is very itchy especially at the seams under the arms.,1
"Poorly built, cheap Chinese/Vietnamese shoe with poor craftsmanship. I had to return these because the shoe was so poorly built. There was cheap glue bursting from where the midsole and upper connect. This type of lazy craftsmanship and lack of QC says it all. We should not see globs of glue. Also, the upper and midsole had space around some of the seems, like it had already begun to separate. I wrote Merrell, and they said to just return them to the retailer, so I did. But boy was that a bad first impression. I think Merrell writes fake reviews, because these are not 4.5 star shoes.. Or people just accept that their shoes that won't last and have very low standards. The shoe market is pretty dire if these are considered good shoes.",0
"Fake, fake, fakeAvoid this one. I have worn many Clarks shoes in my time and made quite a few purchases on Amazon, but I got taken on this one. These were just the worst pair I ever purchased, can't return them and cannot even find someone to give them to, these are terrible.",0
The jacket I received is not a same as on a picture.,1
I didn't like the way the credit card sleeves were laid out and there was no zippered compartment.  It was also slightly ugly.  I sent it back.,1
"Do not buy jeans from Amazon. I just now got them after the return window. Only to learn that they are very bad fakes.Now I cannot even return them!Very thin material,There is even a repair that has been done.They are not shaped like real Levis or even like jeans for that matter.Made in Columbia.There is no link for me to leave feedback. Very convenient for hiding bad business practices.",0
It had tiny holes even before I wore it. I put it on to see if I could wear it out.,0
The boots had a lot of marks and dust. It came so late night. Delivery was terrible.  I will be returning item.,0
"Looks nice, but can't get cards in and out of slots easily.  The ID stitching came out the first time I removed by license.  Very disappointed :(",1
"didn't fit right. Tried two different pairs of these and the croch hung 2/3 way down my thigh. Felt like I was saggin my pants,even with the belt line hoisted to my belly button. Lol. Felt like good quality and what not just didn't fit as expected.",1
"Well I normally like Sanuks. I go back and forth between them and rainbows. 31 days after delivery the layers of the sole seperated half way down the flop. I will say i only wore these flops a handful of times. I wish it would have happened a few day earlier to be in the return window. Oh well, order some more rainbows today.",0

"I've had this watch for three and a half years now, and never take it off.  I wear it through a shower and overnight in bed, and it's taken quite a beating.  Through bartending, intramural sports, and everyday activities, I've scuffed up the band some, but as promised, the face of the watch is utterly unmarked.The watch itself is so classically designed and elegant without being loud.  I feel comfortable wearing it with sweatshirts as I do a cocktail dress, and though the blank Movado face takes awhile to get used to in terms of telling time, I can't imagine going anywhere without it now.The batteries recently ran out a few weeks ago - after a $15 battery replacement, I fully expect to wear this watch for another good 3 years.  I can't recommend this highly enough.***UPDATE***Ironically, two months after I wrote this review, the watch began to steadily lose minutes despite another battery change quickly following the last; I must have jinxed myself bragging about how I'd wear it for another few years.So, with this first watch's machinery now out of commission, I purchased the exact same model from Amazon.  Within two months of purchase, with regular, non-strenous wear, the face got scratched on its sapphire crystal scratch resistant face which is guaranteed for a lifetime.Unfazed, I contacted Movado customer service, who directed I send it into a repair shop nearby.  I did so, in July.  It is now the following March and not only have I been contacted by them, they claim that they never received the item despite the fact that I purchased delivery confirmation on the package, which clearly shows that it was delivered.I am at a loss of what to do.  An obviously loyal customer previous to this, I now have to retract my gushing recommendation I previously gave, because as soon as the going got tough, Movado's customer service got going.  I essentially lost $300 right off the bat.  Very disappointing that their watch was not good quality and then they followed this up with a refusal to acknowledge anything had ever occurred with me.  Dishonest company - don't purchase from them.",0
" i order item high expect , review seller , product good .when i receiv product i expect brand name slipper .no .i receiv slipper label .the product descript say sole rubber , sole compress foam , otherwis extrem cheap !i would n't suggest wear slipper anyon !it fit expect , comfort , cheap , anyth like descript .",1
The quality is low. Returned it.,1
"Converse Chuck Taylors, often mentioned as a good option for a minimalist shoe, are quite the opposite. The toebox is far too small, way to narrow and cramped for your toes to spread out. There were some Loose Fit Oxes once upon a time, but Converse refuses to make them anymore. They want to crush our feet into some narrow ideal foot shape for reasons beyond my comprehension. I have also read that the soles separate very easily from the main shoe now with the new models So these are utter crap now.TIP: Avoid Vans because while they allow your foot more room, your heel will slide in and out of the shoe. You can use Feiyues, but there are no solid black styles. However they are the most comfortable, and will not allow your heel to slide in and out.",1
"UPDATE: I purchased this shoe a couple years ago, wrote a stellar review because it's a great shoe.  Unfortunately, my lovely wife, meaning well, polished the pair solid black (even the threading).  While still a nice comfortable shoe, the custom look and style is literally blacked out.  So I reordered a 'back up' pair.  Long story short, got a completely different shoe.  Looked and felt like plastic.  No longer the nice soft leather of the original.  Paul Sunday's review and photos are exactly what I experienced.  Completely different shoe.  So, I returned this 'fake' pair.  I'll go to a brick and mortar shop to find the 'real' shoe.Previous review of first pair:Highly recommend this shoe.  Nice easy loafer with unique structure and stitching.  This is my third pair of Cole Hahn shoes and in all cases, the sizing was off.  I wear 11.5, but had to return and get these in 12.5 wide to fit comfortably.  Keep that in mind when ordering.",0
small and damaged after first try,1
A full size too large,1
"very thick for its size which some reason looks bigger in the pictures but in real life this watch is tiny, to a point that it almost looks like a ladies watch. Also the quality of the band wasn't up to par. it felt light and cheaply made which made me think the one I bought was a fake.",0
These wouldn't stay up and roll down while walking. I wouldn't get them again.,1
The wrong side I order 9w and get 9m,1
I ordered this product and subsequently found a video on youtube that detailed how to determine if a kanken product is fake.The logo patch on the front was not reflective and the stitching on the inside was poorly done and fraying.Be careful when ordering name brand products!,0

"Complete and total junk!  I had heard about these boots for years and when my Danners wore out I tried a pair.  They look and feel very cheap.  Within a month they were already starting to fall apart....interior came loose and tore, very cheap laces broke, soles separated, fake leather cracked.  I paid a lot for them and had to replace them with a pair of Danners after about three months when the sole completely detached.  Run screaming in the opposite direction of these boots.",0
"I'd give zero stars if it'd let me. I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a 5x instead of my regular 1x and this barely fit my thigh, not to mention it already had a hole in it. Terrible, waste of money.",1
"I'm 99% sure this is fake leather. I wouldn't buy again, and certainly not for the price. Also the color is much worse in person.",0
" Beware received today even get noticing run , package already opened , looked like returned pair !",0
"I bought there and recently pull them out (cold weather is coming in) the inside of the shoe tag isn't right. Missing logos, stamp isn't crisp and not in the right place. I can go on. But other then that you really have to look to see it's a fake.",0

I was OK with that....our gift exchange was the 24th.  On the 22nd, I received a shipping status update ""delivery on schedule for December 23"".  At that point I knew I did not need to go out and get another gift....it would be here just in the nick of time.  Nope.  Still waiting...order is still in shipping mode.  Had I known it would not of arrived in time...I would have either changed the delivery method, if that was an option, or I would have purchased elsewhere, where quicker delivery was available.  So....I can't vouch for the quality yet, just the fact that I won't order from this site again.",0
This product is 100% fake don't buy it or you will regret for spending your money :(((,0
"The description says they are ""Made in US"", but when I got them, they have a tag saying they are ""Made In Mexico"".  Not sure why a false description is allowed to stay on Amazon.  They are being returned now.",1
Was damaged and it is a pretty crappy product.  The sound is pretty lame and the chainsaw is drowned out by a really fake sounding woman's scream.,0
I will be returning them for a refund --  I had been trying to find a bra just like this one - since the current bras -- filled with latex are hard to wear in hot climates and feel like a padded bra.,1
"I ordered Queen Size in the hose even though I am 5'7"" and weight 155 lbs, I do have fairly long legs and thought the queen would work.  I couldn't even get them over my hips, in fact they ran so small that they barely made it to the top of my thighs, which are pretty slender.  Too bad because the color was perfect, but I just couldn't use them.  I didn't return them because I just plain forgot.",1
WHN I GOT IT  IS  fake  disappointed,0
Metal already poked through on the first day wearing it.  I know it's an economy one but still expected a bit more ruggedness.,1

"Do not buy these tights. I bought them and was ultra-careful with them, yet on the first day they ripped in multiple places. The rips started out small but by the end of the day it was all over. Can never wear again and am not happy as I spent over $10 on these.",1
Ordered the bag in Fog and the one I received is fake. I compared it to the one in Warm Yellow that I purchased in the Fjallraven store in Soho in NYC. Snap-buttons were a different size and the material of the logo on the front is different. Interior name tag has a completely different lay-out as well.,0
"Either the wrong item was sent to me or the image shown for my selection is incorrect. Photo shows entirely black and white converse, I received black and white and yellow with different laces. Not only that, (I would contemplate keeping them) but the material doesn't seem as nice and the white above the toes looks sloppy. Will return them.",1

This is my fourth pair of these slippers. I have been questioning if these are fake. They seem very cheaply made. The fur or whatever it is looks like its about to come off. The sole seam weak. Not the same quality as my other pairs. Not impressed at all!,0
"Not what is in the picture. I ordered this thinking I would get the solid colors pictured above what I received were bright Orange patterned and Horrible! super thin cotton and elastic has no stretch. Avoid making my mistake, Do not buy these!",1
I bought two pairs. One pair was ok but the second pair got a run the first day I wore them!,1
If they were wide maybe fine.,1
The seller refused to pay to return them. The shoes were way too big & useless now.,0
"great product if you're 7 feet tall. For a person under 6 feet tall these are pants which leave only your ankles exposed. They're like black ups pants. Rugged, stiff as a board, but way way too long to be called shorts. I'd call them pants that shrank a bit. Pretty much exactly as in the photo",1
These tights were great but I got one wear out of them before they ripped. The control top material separated from the legging portion. So disappointed.,1

I am 5'2'' and 110 lbs and according to the size chart I should be a size A/B, but when I got them they were very difficult to put on. They were very thin and tight, so it was hard to adjust them and get them up my legs (it was a very delicate process), and when I did get them how I wanted them, they began to develop runs and tears almost immediately. I didn't even get a chance to get out of the house before there was a hole in the thigh area, and I don't have very large legs. All it took was a little walking around and bending to put on shoes. Overall I was very disappointed with them, and if you order them maybe try going  a size up from what is recommended on the size chart to avoid wasting money on something you won't be able to wear.",1
got a run almost immediately after I put them on! I had to run to the CVS to get some Hanes nylon which I wish I did in the first place. Terrible!,1
I was very disappointed with these Levis when they arrived and I inspected them they seemed fake the Levi sign on the back was of very poor quality and it was not sewed down when I held them up you could see the light through the pants very thin,0

It is not full grain leather as stated in the product description.  I ordered this as I was trying to get something better than the cheap genuine leather belts that are found at most department stores.  It turns out this is just a more expensive version of those.  I wear size 32 jeans so I ordered a size 34 belt and it is so small that I can barely get the belt to fit in the first hole.  I've worn it twice and it is already bending and warping.  Would never order another belt from this company again.,1

"This is NOT ""full grain, waxed bridle leather"" as STILL shown in the product description. It is ""genuine leather"".You should be able to tell from the Wiki definition that this belt will not last:""The following are not ""true"" organic leathers, but are materials that contain leather fiber. Depending on jurisdiction, they may still be labeled as ""Genuine Leather"", even though the consumer generally can only see the outer layer of the material and can't actually see any of the leather content:Bonded leather or ""Reconstituted leather"" is an economical type that uses leftovers of organic leather (often from leather tanneries or leather workshops) which are shredded and then bonded together with polyurethane binders or latex on top of a fiber sheet. The varying degree of organic leather in the mix (between 10% and 90%) affects the smell and the texture of such product. Due to its reduced cost it is becoming a popular choice for furniture upholstery, especially for commercial use, where durability is needed; however durability can vary widely, depending on the formulation.Bycast leather is a split leather with a layer of polyurethane laminated to the surface and then embossed. Bycast was originally made for the shoe industry and later adopted by the furniture industry. The original formula created by Bayer was strong but expensive. The result is a material that is slightly stiffer but cheaper than top-grain leather but has a much more consistent texture. Because its surface is completely covered in plastic, is easier to clean and maintain, but is not easily repaired.""",1

My old hanes have an elastic waistband that's not totally covered and it chafes when taking off and it's not very comfortable, but I'm desperate, which is why I decided to try hanes again. The underwear market is terrible, so consider these despite my negative review. Fruit of the loom also fails to completely cover the waistband elastic and also the leg elastics. Old Hanes does cover the leg elastics, but it's very thin in that area. I liked reebok (double layer in front), but the front center vertical seam was irritating a sensitive area, but I still think still reebok might work for some people who are not as sensitive as I am and want 2 layers in the front area, although it took 1 year for reebok to bother me. Jockey elance men's are too small, too tight, and too thin (1 ultra thin layer), but have fully covered elastics, although a bit thin and cheap. Jockey right side seam is thick and irritating. Sadly, all brands have problems. Good luck. Reebok has the best waistband and leg openings even though they have unnecessary front center seams.",1
Shoes came in the wrong size and low top. The color was the only thing right! The fabric stank so bad I sent the shoe back right away and did not order a replacement! I cancelled my order.,1

"These vests look great online and ok in person. If you're only going to use them once, they're OK I guess and will help you fake it temporarily. Be aware, they are supposedly 100% polyester as the ad specifies the tie and vests are made of the same material. I'm not sure if that's correct, perhaps the back of the vest is polyester. The front feels like plastic and wearing these vests feels like wearing a tarp. It's not even what I would consider real cloth. It has the consistency of those one-time-use plastic table covers and is as thin as paper.The ties are ok. They're not silk, they are 100% polyester, but that's ok. The styles are very fashionable and they look good.Overall it's just not for me, the quality of the vest is too poor to keep, and I'm going to try to return it. Will update if I run into trouble.",1
"I am used to similar ""big tongue"" shoes by brands like Vans.  Since they no make the Vans shoe that I typically purchase, I decided to give Etnies a try.  I use the shoes as my daily shoes when not at work, just for basic walking around. So far, I'm not impressed.  The tongue and other aspects of the shoe are comfortable but the sole/insole pretty much is not.  I feel like I am wearing a cheap pair of shoes from Walmart.  I actually double/triple checked to make sure the pair I got weren't counterfeit as I have experienced that before when buying Nike basketball shoes on Amazon.  These aren't much more comfortable than the fake Nikes that I sent back.  So, I will give these shoes 2 stars in hopes that they will break in and be better.  If so, I may raise my rating at that time.",0

"I was a PUMA enthusiast mainly because every PUMA sneaker I've ever purchased (ebay,amazon&outlets) was under $30.

I know first hand because I've walked 5 miles in these shoes and it was not only noisy (sweaty feet) but also very discomforting.

"Ordered the size 12 boot after using a size 13 that stretched out too much.  The size 12 arrived and was closer to a 10 1/2.  Ordered a second pair in 14 and fits perfectly.  Doc Marten boots seem to change their sizing standards over the past few years.  Otherwise, after a month of hard use in the Arabian desert they still look like new with a splash of water in the sink.They broke in quickly like all dpc marten boots and were form fitted after a couple days use.  Never have had a blister or sore foot with these.  I would use these at the gym and for running if I didn't look silly doing it. They are more comfortable and have more support than any gym shoe I have used.For a long day trudging around a hot dusty yard, or hours driving a semi truck, or going on a trek thru the mountains, these are well worth it.PS look for the made in UK doc martens, the leather and sewing is much better than the Chinese made ones.  I think the UK made doc martens have the word ""legacy"" in the product description.Update April 20.2011Have used these boots since October 2010. 7 months.  Stitching is coming out, the leather loop on the top has broke on one boot cause the stitching was faulty.  The soles on both shoes are coming apart from the shoes.  Insole wore out in a month, the inside of the heel where my foot meets the back of the boot has bulged out at the back and split the leather.  The boots are no longer comfortable and springy.Disappointed in the quality of Doc Marten.  I had other pairs of doc martens shoes that lasted much much longer than this.  This is the second pair of bad doc martens in a row.  They used to be a good shoe when made in UK now just cheap Chinese junk.",1

"I ordered this helmet thinking it would be better than the 2 piece mask that came with the Deluxe Boba Fett costume.  I Do not buy this if you are expecting anything better.The visor is half vinyl, half plastic visor.  Not sure why. You can see this in the stock photo, and I should have noticed it before purchasing because its not what I would expect.The overall shape of the helmet is just not quite right. It seems to be constructed too narrow overall.  The bottom of the ""visor"" is tapered outward from the top, and is then too wide at the bottom. The profile of the mask also extends outwards.  The paint job is not that great.  The red is very dull.  Its also lacks the contrast of the greens on the mask.The only pro's is that its a helmet, not a mask, and it has the dent in the top..and an antenna that leans to one side. ",1

"Unfortunately Guess messed with a great and 'near' perfect product. The first key difference is that this watch used to come in a box set watch with a brown and a black strap. But I could live with that but then they changed the color from a beautiful dark brown to the current lighter color which makes it look fake.  However, the biggest change they made that really spoilt it for me was changing the color of the thread/stitching used from white to a brown matching the leather.  The white stitching gave it a great contrast with the dark brown leather and really set this watch off. Incidentally they did the same with the black strap as well. I had the original, and the reason I said 'near' perfect was because the loop used to insertthe excess strap into broke easily and the buckle as well. This could easily be solved by sewing the loop into the strap and using a higher quality leather.",1

"Oakley 8"" Assault Boots - TemperateThere are several different Oakley assault boot configurations and it isn't because they're made in different countries. There's a temperate climate boot that does not have stitching all around the outside of the sole, and it is a much warmer boot. It's available in black or desert tan. Then there's the desert boot only available in desert tan. This is made of a lighter material with stitching all around the outer sole.The boots I purchased are the black temperate climate boots made in China. I found that they're sized about one half a size smaller than athletic shoes. I normally wear size 12 sneakers, and I had to step down to size 11.5 with the Oakleys. The leather construction is cheap, as in $30 worth of cheap. It feels like the fake leather they use on cheap belts or wallets, nothing like the leather used on military issued boots.There's a sticky leather used around the inside of the boot neck and at the heel. The heel leather tends to peel off. The rubber used for the sole and around the forward part of the boot is of medium stiffness, but the boot still needs break-in time to feel flexible. The ankle area feels extremely stiff out of the box and Oakley should have gone to an all-Cordura material for flexibility. The soles are still rather thick and don't feel like sneakers. They also make a lot of noise when wet and they also squeak on polished surfaces. The tread compound appears to wear easily.The price of these boots was definitely not commensurate with the manufacturing quality. I've read numerous complaints from owners regarding the boots falling apart within 6 months and I don't have any reason to doubt these reports.I noticed quite a few movies that had main characters sporting Oakley's latest accessories (backpacks, optics, footwear). Terminator Salvation was one of them. John Connor seemed to show off the Oakleys whenever possible, but in a manner that made it seem like the boots were uncomfortable.Pros: Fairly stylish, soles have decent traction on rough surfaces, feels light weightCons: Still needs break-in time, felt very stiff, still did not feel like running shoes, ankle area was too tight, cheap construction and materials, extremely high price tag - most ""military-spec"" boots are available at a lower costOverall: 2/5 stars, you're paying the price premium for the Oakley brand",0

Color was not really a match for the picture provided.  The only way I can describe it is a brighter yellowish.  I had read reviews and ordered a half size smaller so that it would fit well and it still was a bit to big.

"The best attribute of the adidas Samba is that it is extremely durable.  Much of that durability is linked to its 100% leather construction.  Of particular note is the suede toe area, which bears the brunt of much soccer-related activity.The shoes that were delivered to me were not leather.  They are mostly vinyl, with some sort of odd synthetic material in place of the toe.  The supposed-to-be suede toe areas were cut to visibly different sizes on the right and left shoe.  Further, the material that was used in place of suede proved to be extremely cheap.  The shoe was worn in the rain once, whereupon the fake suede material promptly ripped.",0

It's not even the same logo!I don't know if this is the seller's fault. Maybe they buy by the bulk and look for the cheapest price, not familiar with the particular logos and fits of everything they sell. I could understand that, if that were the case. However, most of the reviews indicate that most of the customers have gotten the real shirts, especially the ones that indicate the fit being right but being a bit short in torso length as the original brand's flaw is known to be. I do know that this is not what I ordered.You can see in the photos I have uploaded the real one laid on top of the fake one, both size Large as indicated in the second photo which also shows the cheap and poor attempt at faking the branding.",0

Really do your research when buying the boots. I brought these for my boyfriend but he never even say them because I immediately knew they were fake. The boots were stained two totally different colors. The seal around the bottom of the boot was sloppy you could clearly see the glue and Timberland is known for neatness. The stamp on the side also says Timberland Pro soft toe on the timberland website it says Timberland Pro pro series. Also on the Timberland website the boot says waterproof on the tongue that is absent on the boots from Amazon.,0

"I love aviator glasses. I have owned a few through out the years. This time I wanted to try the mirror type. I have to say, this Blue model isn't just mirror but it is very flashy. Kinda too much, at least for me.The real problem for me is these glasses have a lot of reflection and you won't be able to see well depending on the light condition as the light bounces back or you get to see your own eye (sort of) in the glasses.I have had it for a few days and I thought I can get use to it but no. It's too much for me. Just be aware of this when ordering. Occasional use should be OK I guess.BTW, these are real and not fake!UPDATE:The reflection is unbearable...I thought it only does it in certain light conditions but let's say you can barely avoid it....Now I have to see if I can return them. Sometimes I have more problem seeing when having these glasses on than naked eye. Why would RayBan allow this? First time I have been very disappointed with RayBan sunglasses. I am taking another star off.",0

"Before you decide based on my 1-star not to buy these, my review is based on the pair I received. I have had two other of these, but in brown/light brown. Both are very comfortable and I've worn them in the snow. My feet were warm and I didn't slide.  (They're probably not designed for snow, though). With these black units, my heals kept coming out. Took me a while to figure out why. The elastic on the top wasn't strong enough -- not like my other colors. I called Merrill, and they sent me new inserts and I wore thicker socks. Same thing. I just sent them to Merrill for inspection. Based upon the new ones they send me, I may change this review.",1

"There is a reason there is not a detailed photo of this patch. Namely, it's a ripoff, a knock off, a whatever you what to call it. It looks nothing like the screen used patches as they claim. I have two theories on this. One, they are so incompetent that they are unable to see the patch on the series. even someone who has only seen part of the show could tell it's completely wrong, let alone a true fan of the series! My second theory I think, is the more likely culprit. Most likely this seller does NOT have permission from MGM to distribute their copyright protected visual or intellectual property. If they were at all even similarly made as the real deal, MGM could sue them into squishes on the pavement. This particular seller is highly misleading. When I got this item for my son he was so excited he lit up like a Christmas tree. He has been watching the entire Stargate franchise with me his ENTIRE life. Literally. He's eleven. When the package arrived he was so happy he was almost floating. He took one brief glance at it and his little face crumbled in front of me. I asked him ""What's wrong sweetheart?"" He handed me the P O S patch and replied ""Does it look like there's something wrong with this, or is it me? This doesn't look like the patch Jack O'Neill and the others have."" I took one look at it and saw that not only was it a total fake, it was a crappy fake. The only this they got right was the symbol for Earth. the stars are in the wrong place an the planet behind the gate symbol could have been from somewhere the team went on the show but, it is DEFINITELY not earth. However, smart move on them, the patch was inexpensive and therefore not really worth the effort to return the P O S. So way to go you (Insert an long , imaginative, multiple curse words or phrases strung together here) you gave my 11-year-old the proverbial piece of coal in his stocking, even though he is a great kid. Amazon should Really take a closer look at your SHADY, underhanded, immoral, and just plain unethical and outright lying business practices. sorry I couldn't get to your review sooner but, I'm not really one to leave a lot of reviews... however, LUCKY YOU, I found time in my busy schedule to give you a review worthy of the item you sent me.

I expect more from you. You claimed this purchase as coming from you, but the packaging and fact that they were knock-offs has lead me to think they weren't. Whoever is selling these is doing your company a disservice.

"I bought two of these watches for my kids to use in camp to time race starts. They need a countdown timer to count down from three minutes and frequently must reset from a partial countdown back to three minutes. Every digital watch I have owned in my life has this feature and resets to the originally set countdown interval with a press of the reset button. This watch requires a manual reset digit by digit, back to the three minutes as if setting for the first time, every time. Furthermore, there was no way to learn this from the product description on the Timex web site or the Amazon web site. Maybe this feature is not important to many people but it is to me.

Oddly, the cup itself was too large in the bottom half and the material puckered, but my breasts still hung out over the top. There is also a seam sewn directly over the nipple.  One bra also appears to have been worn prior to showing up at my door.  My advice, keep scrolling.",1

I have tried to return this thing for 6 months to no avail. Can someone at Buxton contact me? We got this wallet and there was a tear in it right out of the box.,0
Not happy with this purchase at all. I bought these as a gift for my nephew in the UK and ordered the size as instructed by my brother. I took the shoes to England last week on a visit and they were massive. It turns out they are 4cm bigger than they should be! We checked the size and it appeared that the shoes were labeled a different size to what the box and inside the shoe states.,0
"Unfortunately the shoes are definitely not made to last. After wearing them only a handful of times the ""leather"" began to peel off and the side emblems fell off. I was expecting quality from converse. I am very disappointed.",1
I know pantyhose typically tear after a few wears but these after the first time tear.  To expensive to be tearing after a couple of hours of use.,1
I bought this model because it looks great.  I paid $100 for it from one of the department stores.  From the day I bought it the watch has lost about 10 to 15 minutes a day.  I thought it was the battery so I replaced it for $10 but that didn't help.  In order to get it repaired I had to send it to them via special delivery which cost me $12 more.  I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back.  I'm trying to figure out why I'm being asked to pay for repairs for a watch that is clearly under warranty.  I'll be calling them tomorow to find out.  In the meantime.. don't buy a Skagen watch unless you like cheap junk and lousy service.,1
Totally spoils everything is that the mouth hole has nothing in common with the one at the picture.,1

"I had almost the same pair of these white Volatile sneakers about ten years ago.  I had them about eight years.  The brand always ran small so I already knew to order a whole size up.  I was so happy to find these again and at such a deal.  Well, SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND MONEY.  THESE ARE NOT THE SAME SHOES AS I OWNED BEFORE.  My old sneakers were leather and well made, that's why they lasted 8 years.  These sneakers are HARD PLASTIC.  THERE'S NOTHING LEATHER ABOUT THEM.  The description says leather.  The shoe tag says Leather Upper only.  I'm telling you that's a lie. Even the soles are sloppy thrown together, the crest is crooked and these are a generic knock off. I am so disappointed, sad, and mad.  I CAN'T even walk in them.  It's like having huge plastic blocks on your feet and I look like I have medical problems. Seriously. You can't bend the toe box no matter how hard you try and these are nothing more than a rip off. These made in China volatile sneakers should go right back there. I KNOW these used to be a high quality product but now they're nothing more than a door stop.**I just reread the sneaker description.  The description was changed since I placed my order about two months ago. Now it states it's suede but it still shows the item I purchased which is NOT SUEDE OR LEATHER.  I just read some other reviews, also.  CLEARLY there is something wrong here.  Some people said the exact same thing I did.  Others were the opposite saying it's a great purchase.  I think some people have received a real volatile sneaker and most of us received a fake product.  Unless you like gambling, I would not take that chance.  I was heartbroken that these were NOT EVEN CLOSE to my old pair of quality sneakers.  They are HORRIBLE.  Not even decent enough to be called shoes.",0

For practical purposes, I can bet that only one thick college textbook and a notepad could fit in this thing at one time. The size renders it so absolutely useless that you might as well just carry whatever you were going to put in it in your hands. Not to mention that if you're six foot tall or taller, this bag is gonna look hilarious on you-- like you lifted a backpack from a kindergarten cubby or something.

When I wear it, it looks like a yarmulke with a bill. This inside reads 7 and 3/8"" while the product description says ""one size fits all"".

"I've stopped wearing these shoes because of the loud squeaking noise in both shoes. The noise comes from the insole insert rubbing against the shoe interior footbed, particularly near the arch. It is SO annoying! I can hear it over street traffic when walking on a sidewalk. And it is crazy loud when walking inside a quiet building. I did try spraying a silicone lubricant on the underside of the insole, and this quieted the squeaking for a couple of days - but it is back to full volume. The shoes are collecting dust in my closet, and they are now beyond the warranty return period. Don't make the same mistake as me!",1
"Even though the costume looks decent from the front, there is a large zipper on the back that covers the entire length of costume. you need your buddy, wife or girlfriend to zip you up as you can't do it by yourself because of the length of the zipper.Besides the fact that amazon changed the original delivery date from before halloween to after which ruined all my halloween plans and I ended up staying home, the zipper arrived defective out of the pouch. How could a brand near item arrive defective?, thats another story. There are so many flaws on the design that makes you wonder if the designer was trying to get back at his bosses by purposely putting out a defective item.Also if you don't have broad shoulders and super small waist, don't waste your time and money by ordering this.A note to designer if he or she wants to modify this costume:1) make the length longer by at least 3 inches2)get rid of the zipper as we are men (...Bob can you zip me up??? ridiculous!!!)3) make this to fit an average man, not just someone with broad shoulders and a 6- pack stomach",0

Like the color.  The item is useable but the credit card slots and especially the drivers license slot are slightly too tight.  They have not really loosened up any.

I was going to get it as a gift and just order it to his house but my mother kept delaying in getting his address to me. I just decided to have it sent to my house instead. I am glad I did because what I got was a ripoff slim clip. It had a huge dent/crack in it and the metal that is used is cheap and the edges are all sharp. I compared it with mine and it's obviously a fake. It came in no package like the "" as seen on tv"" but instead was in some bubble wrap with a bar code sticker on it. Needless to say i didn't send this one over. The SlimClip imprinted on the front of the clip is definitely not the same as the one printed on mine. Mine is more refined, engraved and not fading.

I ordered the black ones from amazon. however the one I received we rubberized matte black instead of the ""glossy black"" which is the i thought i was purchasing. the looked legit and felt like a quality pair.

So I returned this pair and purchased the polarized black ones from sunglassexpress.update 9/28/2011Received the pair from Sunglassexpress. the box says 52mm, but the glasses are showing 55mm when looking at the armband. So this is not what I ordered. also this pair felt cheaper compared to the one I got directly from Amazon. the ""RB"" etching on the glass is less pronounced on this one in comparison to the previous pair.

Shoes were a little large compared to the other exact shoe I have.,1
I am very disappointed by this purchase. The product description says the case diameter is 40.1mm at the top and I bought the watch for my 10 year old based on this description. I have now received it and the diameter is NOT 40.1mm. Beware- the description is misleading. When I looked again more closely it says down the bottom it is 53mm. It is too big for my son and we are not happy.,1

They do come with the case and paperwork and the name and numbers match with the sunglasses however, the etching on the legs where you can find the info that matches the info on the box is in the incorrect spot and it comes right off when scratched. This is a red flag and no matter how many other things pass the test just the fact that one thing does not pass the test means that they are fake. They can use authentic boxes and cases and paperwork but the sunglasses are not authentic Tom Ford sunglasses. I am glad I bought two different Whitney sunglasses from two different merchants because the other merchant's sunglasses are 100% authentic Tom Ford and so I kept those and will return these fake ones.

The original is made of thick heavy gage metal that cannot bend, which holds your money and cards firmly in place.  This knockoff is made of ""chrome plated"" very thin TIN like metal!  There is absolutely no spring to the metal like the original therefore no means but smashing the metal together to hold your cards and money.  It also has the tin property of very sharp edges.  In pulling the clip out of my pocket, the razor sharp edges cut my finger.  I hope amazon will do the right thing and take this product and vendor off their website.  Love amazon but this is the second time I have recieved a fake knockoff product.  Thankfully amazon is taking back!  BTW?...The original Ontel clip is an awesome product... Highly recommend... Will elevate back pain from a wallet in your back pocket.",0

"I'm bummed that these are without a doubt fake, sold by PrimeDeals Online. They are good fakes, but that's not what you're paying for! Right out of the box, the fit was off, the lens sticker was one I hadn't seen before, and the case was different than normal. I decided to compare it to my real folding wayfarers as these were a my 2nd pair (and in a diff color). The insignia on both sides doesn't match up, along with the color and quality of printing. The font on the interior left is different, the ""RB4105"" is way too far down on the end, and the quality and color of printing doesn't match my pair or even what's printed on the right hand side. On the right, the printing is much fainter and doesn't match the font size of the real ones. The quality of the plastic frame is different and it doesn't sit perfectly flush unfolded in the front hinge area unless I force it into that position. Last but not least, the cleaning cloth was loose in the box (tell-tale sign), the box was beat up, and the ray ban pamphlet was shoved in there. Also the ""ray ban"" on the sides isn't as raised as it should be. Also, the small black case should say ""folding wayfarer"" and is a much softer material than the case I received.If you've purchased these, I'm sorry! You can try to take it up with Amazon or the seller, or contest the charge with your credit card company.In short, I compared these to a pair I bought at an authorized retailer and while they're devent fakes, many things didn't match up.",0

"I have this exact style of Ugg boots ""ultimate short"" in black, that I purchased about 7 years ago, however, back then, they were made in New Zealand. My inner tag inside my boot states so. Since then, they produce them in China and Vietnam. The sheep's wool lining is now very different (almost fake feeling), it doesn't keep your feet nearly as warm, it wears down a lot faster, and doesn't look as pretty (if you cuff or fold you boots over). I compared the new pair I received to the older pair I have. The bottoms of the soles are the same, the double stitching is the same, the suede feels almost the same, just about everything but what I found to be the most important detail......... the shearling or sheep's wool was completely different and very almost seemed fake. I went to the Ugg Australia website and Amazon is one of the trusted retailers so I can only assume that they make sure that third party sellers are trusted retailers are too but maybe not???? That would be  good question I guess. Maybe I need to ask that question to Amazon or Ugg Australia directly. The price I paid for these ($195.99 is the same price they were on the Ugg Australia website but they were out of stock in my size, otherwise I would have just got them there. I am going to go to a retail store & compare the wool lining and see if it is up to par with my older pair & that will tell me if the pair I received on Amazon was fake or if the newer ones made in China are just now poorly made. I will post an update to my review.UPDATE:I received the pair I ordered from Zappos just a few days after writing this review. They were a few dollars more (they charge sales tax & Amazon does not). The boots I received from Zappos came with boot protectors (a plastic support that keeps the boots shape) which is important when storing them) especially for suede) because they tend to slouch and loose shape when not being worn. They also came with stickers on the bottom of the soles and additional packaging that was not present on the pair I received from the 3rd party seller I bought from on Amazon. I also have to say that the shearling/wool lining on the Zappos pair was better quality than the pair I got from Amazon! Now I am starting to wonder whether Amazon verifies their 3rd parties sellers as ""authorized"" sellers of Ugg Australia retailers or makes sure that they are reputable sellers or if they just wait until they get complaints, and then remove them as sellers???? This would also be a good question for Ugg Australia who I may call as well. None the less, I am happy with my boots from Zappos and I even called Zappos & told them that Amazon had the same boots for $199.95 and didn't charge tax and she gave me a credit to my credit card. I am a VIP member with them but I thought it was a nice gesture. I have run into some very good ""fake"" Uggs on ebay and with all the Uggs being made in China & Vietnam now, it really pays to do your research. These were $199.95 on the Ugg website so it wasn't worth saving a few dollars & taking the risk of getting fakes in the end.As for this style boot, I want to mention, that it is one of the few that has removable / replaceable insoles which is a huge plus. For $14.95 on Zappos website, you can buy the replacement insoles and you will have a brand new (feeling) pair of boots. They last several months with daily use. Because the wool wicks away moisture they are meant to be worn withOUT socks and can be worn in the winter OR summer. As long as you condition the outside of your boots with a silicone based spray each season and buy new insoles each winter & summer, your boots will last a lifetime! Just remember to stuff your boots with plastic bags during the time when your not wearing them or lay them flat so they don't slouch. Also try not to tuck heavy jeans inside them or they the cuffs will stretch because leather/suede does stretch. I wear my Uggs with leggings or tight pants anyway. Ugg Classics are cheaper but the outsoles are not made to last and wear down quite quickly with normal walking. They also are not as comfortable. None of the Uggs have good arch support but at least the Ugg Ultimate and Ultra have good durability when it comes to the soles. I have a pair that I have worn over 7 years with no major wear to the soles.",0

Just got this for a Christmas present for my Grandson. It must have been returned by someone else. There are 2 seams torn out and 1 that someone tried to repair by hand.  The back has a run in the fabric and the Velcro has been pulled off on the cape and just barely hanging on the neck opening.  Several of the seams look like they would tear out the first time it is worn.  I don't have time to return it so I am just going to sew it and reinforce the seams before I give it to him.  I would not suggest buying this if you don't want to fix it. Poor quality control!,1

I do a *lot* of movement in my job and prefer sheer stockings to opaque for the aesthetic. I'm always on the lookout for a sheer black tight that is resistant to runs and will last me a few wears.

These are definitely NOT the same sambas I purchased 5 years ago. And it's so heart breaking. These shoes (the old style) were TANKS. I have worked in busy kitchens my entire life and these bad boys were the greatest shoes I've ever had. They lasted SO LONG. Mine are at least 5 years old and I would still wear them except the rubber part on the toe is finally coming apart.THESE.ARE.NOT.THE.SAME.SHOE.AS. BEFORE.Different design. Different shape. Cheaper materials. The bottoms of the new sambas don't even look rubber and they are definitely a different color. They are so squeaky to walk in too. I bought the same exact size as I did in the past and these new ones don't even fit the same. My foot constantly slips out and frankly they just don't look as bad ass as they used to. They look cheap. I've attached pictures that show the differences. Will be returning these. Fingers crossed that the ones I recieved are just a fake pair and the Adidas outlet sells my old babies. 0/10 would not recommend,0
"UPDATE:I totally take back my original review! These are terrible tank tops! After wearing for a few hours, it was so stretched out, it was like wearing a dress.

They ARE long enough though.Previous review:There were some other reviews that say these tanks are not long, as described. In my opinion, they were definitely long enough! Hits me right where my leg meets my pelvis. They are just what I expected them to be from the product description. I'm a size 14 with a large bust. XL fits perfectly! The fabric quality isn't the best and I'm expecting theme to be worn out by the end of summer. but they are perfect for what they are! What can you expect for how in-expensive they are?

I am disappointed that the wallet is only leather on the exterior and this was not conveyed in the description.

Runs small and narrow. Not as comfortable as mic I bought 10 yrs ago. They fit like a cloud and have been my go to shoe since the first time I wore them,1
The size no matches with the info in website,1
"My girlfriend was so let down to have these arrive only to be fakes. Thankfully she did her research otherwise it might have gone unnoticed.All real Uggs should have an authenticity label sewn into the left boot. Google it to see what I mean but it should have several circles that change from light to dark/black when rotated in the light. This should be sewn right next to the label with the sizing info. Funny thing was the box had the sticker like a real box would and it even contained the card with instructions how to authenticity using the method I described above. Unfortunetly her left boot had no such label. The fur was also very sratchy and not soft, also they had a faint paint smell; both further indications of being fakes.Do your research and don't assume you are getting the real thing. Ive started the return process with Amazon but sad we now have to wait for a refund on such an expensive purchase.",0
"The shoes run large. If you are normally a size 11, I suggest you go with a size 10 in these shoes.",1
"Shoes were great and size was correct, but the shoes were too loose and slipped too much when walking. Going down a size would be too short. Shoes were returned for refund.  Merrell are my favorite shoes, but these slip-ons did not work out for me. All of my Merrell shoes are tie shoes, so instead I purchased 'Lock Laces(TM)' for my Merrell tie shoes and they are working great, so far!",1
"Massively oversized I know the description says 13 inch and loose but these are way to big, if you're in the market for dickies go with the 11 inch regular fit. These will fit you like pants.",1
I wish giving the product no stars was an option.  Very poor quality.  Fell apart the first time my son wore it.  I should have saved my money & made him one!,1
Very smelly,1
This shoe looks great but runs a little small and the leather crinkles very easy in the toe area I have only worn them twice and there so crinkled it looks like I've worn them forever I would not recommend these shoes to anyone,1
"These are NOT original Lamo Australian slippers as reflected in the photos.  These are from a Lamo spinoff called Dije of California and made in CHINA!  I've worn Lamo for years and decided since my last pair was on its last wears to purchase this normally wonderful soft and longlasting brand.  Well, I was sadly disappointed.  These slippers are of poor quality, too small by 1 size (I always purchase 1/2 size larger to wear with socks), fake sheepskin and have horrible/crooked cheap soles.  The seller should change the posting to reflect the new photos and information as  reflected on Lamo's website, clearly state the MADE IN CHINA quality and change the name to Dije of California, NOT LAMO!  I will not purchase Lamo again as they no longer manufacture their own slippers/booties.",0

"This bra has such great reviews I was so excited to order it after reading a million nursing bra reviews on Amazon. I was so disappointed when I received it, because the product description states the fabric content is nylon and spandex, but that is totally incorrect.Here is the fabric content from the label of the package:Fiber content (exclusive of trim) 90% nylon 10% spandexFoam cup insert - lining 100% polyesterFoam 100% polyurethaneUnfortunately, I have extremely sensitive skin, and am allergic to all polyester clothing. It makes my skin itch and burn the minute I put it on. I put the bra on when it arrived to see how it fit, and immediately felt my skin itching. I took it off in surprise, and looked at the package to discover the lining is polyester!  The satin trim around the edges is also polyester I'm guessing, since it was just as irritating to my skin. Sooo disappointed as I will have to keep hunting for the right nursing bra.",1
The quality is really poor. They ripped after one use. I would not buy these again.,1

"These are FAKE converse. I've been wearing converse for the past decade and I could tell they were fake immediately. First of all the don't have the ""chuck Taylor"" patch on the inner side of the shoe. Second the top white toe part of the shoe is way bulkier. Third the bothom of souls don't have any safe material on it and all Original converse are suppose to have some soft material.They are a very good knock off. But  I'm sure anyone who's had real ones can immediately spot that THEY ARE FAKE",0
"I thought I ordered my size per the instructions but it was way too large. The straps aren't the greatest, wish they had been thinner straps and no way to adjust them at all.",1

"Bought these and they are definitely NOT good quality.  Creases on various parts of the boots, sloppy yellow stitching around the sole, as well as scuffed up sides on the soles and indented areas near the stitching.  See pictures. Buyers beware.  Definitely not worth your money!  I actually bought these to replace a pair that I bought from Onlineshoes.com that are too small - other differences in the two pairs are that the Amazon ones are made in China - the pair from OnlineShoes are made in Vietnam. The pair from OnlineShoes have the Dr Marten logo imprinted on the actual shoe - the Amazon ones do not have any logo.  They look fake. The pair I received was sold from PlanetShoes through amazon.  Hope this helps!",0

I could only wear it for one hour and had to remove it. My back itched like crazy from the stiff fabric. I'm used to wearing soft Maidenform bras, so this one just wasn't for me. I can't imagine having to wear this all day!",1

"Update, Mar 2015This is an update to the original review of 4 stars I gave the product.No more than 3 months of use of the slippers, indoors only even though they are designed for outdoors too, the heel split on the side, shedding pieces of rubber from the inside all over the house, and revealing an empty space under the heal.I really tried to like this slipper, even dismissing a suspicion of it being a fake product by calling the manufacture to ensure that despite the different display on the web page (see original review below for details) these were originals. Nevertheless it seems the manufacturer did not bother to change the photo of the display, or comment that there might be different versions of the same slipper.If this is the case - the originals are, as others had claimed before me, a very low quality product and should not be sold by Amazon.Sure enough, Amazon, based on the evidence, decided to stop selling this product, and provide me with a refund for this purchase.Great customer service demonstrated again, and a good decision to take it off.Original review, downgraded to 1 starHaving read some of the recent reviews about the disappointing experience of getting a knock off, I was disappointed when my slippers arrived and were of one color, unlike the photo on the page. We called Amazon, and were pleasantly surprised to be handled by a rep who spoke fluent English for a change, who apologized on behalf of Amazon, and created a replacement for me at no additional charge to be shipped overnight. He suggested that if the second item is still suspicious we should notify Amazon again and they will take it off their site to investigate, and reimburse us of course.We thought it was a very reasonable solution, and when the (second) pair arrived the next day...they were the same as the first - one color.However, we did not notice any of the other defects that were described (and photographed) by other reviewers, so we decided to further check the authenticity of the item we received with Old Friend directly. We wrote the following email:Hello,We bought a pair of men's alpine slipper style: 481116 from Amazon. The picture on the Amazon website looked exactly like the one on the Old Friend website a dark brown upper with a two tone sole. The box it came in looked authentic. It was sold by Amazon and not a re-seller. The shoes we received were one color same for both the upper and sole. The sole did not have the two tones that the web picture shows. We are concerned that these may be knock offs. I have enclosed a few pics for your review.Let me know if these are your shoes.Thanks,(I've attached the photos we sent to this review).The next day we received the following response:Hello,The product you received is not a knock off. They are real authentic Old Friend Footwear Alpine Slippers. The sole is the exact same as pictured just one color instead of two.Thanks,Old Friend Sales TeamDirect: 9523585640Toll Free: 8005374361Sales@oldfriendfootwear.comWe also intend to notify Amazon about the misleading photo on this page, but we are convinced these are authentic.I'm giving them 4 star just for now for all the trouble we had to go through, however for now they feel very good - fit, form, warmth, and comfort. To be continued if things change.",0
"OK I had a lot of hope in this product: could not quite lose the 10 more pounds that would have made my wedding dress look perfect. Size 12 trying to look like a size 10. I would have settled for something in between, but the way these worked on me was to push some of the lower belly fat UP making me look truely worse than if I had just left myself alone. Now I have to say they are amazingly comfortable and if I had gotten the ones that go up to my chest I might have been happier. Oh yes, and THEY DEFINITELY ROLLED when I sat down which was irritating at my reception. Good luck with whatever you do...",1

"Pros-The sole of the shoe is thick with rubber meaning that it will last for a long time.It looks very good (in my opinion).Cons-The size is actually 0.5 small than it actually is (in my case, I wear a 7.5 but I had to get 8 to fit).Not very comfortable. It hurts a lot when you walk long distances (I only walked a straight 2 miles with these to realize during the first mile that these shoes WERENT BUILT FOR WALKING. And after I finished walking I had to take these shoes off and massage my feet. This memory foam thing is fake .Not built for winter. I live in a cold climate and it snows a lot, these shoes don't have a good grip with the snow compared to my casual shoes.Too many logos on the shoes. The pictures provided by the seller barely shows any logos, it was a major reason on why I bought it. It really depends on your preference but for me, I don't like the words Sketchers and waterproof written all over my shoe (especially on the tongue of the shoes where you will see a sentence written down.",0
Costume fits great but there is a hole in the seam on the arm.,1

Instead it's kind of white cheap/fake leather all crocked!On the outside - the front is not well finished (with some issues in the white stitching).Are these original Sebago or contrafeit? The quality control was not applicable to this one, for sure!!Regards,Miguel Silva",0

I could barely hook this bustier it was so tight.  And then could not breathe when it was hooked.  Definitely order one size up.  Cup size is ok.  It took so long to get this delivered from Bare Necessities that the scheduled date for the fitting of my mother-of-the-groom dress arrived and I had to purchase something else for the fitting and then return this bustier.  It took 11 days to receive this item and I had to write urgent and complaining emails twice.  They sent it the slowest way possible with US mail delivery at the end.,0

"Believe the other (bad) reviews that you read about this.My wife ordered this as a prop to go with a costume and upon opening the box it was apparent that this is a very, very cheaply made item. Not that you would expect much from a prop, but better than this for the money. The handle is made of thin bamboo, which, in the case of the one she received the handle was severely cracked. Needless to say we did not bother to remove the wrap from the bristles so I can't speak to that. Right back in the box and right back to Amazon.I am glad that she purchased this through Amazon, no hassle returning. Thank you Amazon!",1

First of all, the fit was just a bit too large which allowed them to occasionally turn on their sides on uneven terrain.  Yes, that does result in unpleasant ankle twisting!  As uncomfortable and annoying as that was, it did not compare to the constant and incredibly annoying squeak that announced my arrival from about fifty feet out (not an exaggeration).  Overall they were okay, I guess, but the ankle twisting and tortuously annoying squeak was too much.  I returned them for a refund, and that went perfectly smoothly!",1
Really hard to determine size with these. The options are kind of ridiculous. Too big and I even used a previous pair of these to order the same size. Waste of money for me to have to spend to ship back.,1

I ordered these in a wide and I was excited that they are wide. Still took a little breaking in but eventually were really comfortable.

I was able to ascertain that I had ordered the right size as I got my foot - heel still hung up  - near the toe.  But even if I was successful, after struggling for 10 minutes, I don't have time for major surgery in order to get dressed in the morning!  Sadly, I sent these back.  I did not order another larger pair because the issue with getting past the heel would still remain.  My feet have actually gotten smaller with age - so the other reviewers comment about extra large feet, and sedentary lifestyles made by a true ""deep thinker"" aren't applicable.  Very frustrated.",0
"I'm pretty sure these shoes are fakes. I have 4 pairs of Toms, all of which fit perfectly and are super comfy. These shoes are so small I can't even get them on. He logo is also crooked. I'm trying to get a refund. This is a scam.",0
"When I am expecting a delivery I check my front door, especially if I have been out. Only today after checking online did I find that the slippers had been delivered ""at my front door"", however the box was at least two feet from my front door, where there is no overhang protection. Since we are having record snow fall, this was very careless. In the past, I have been happy with UPS delivery, not today.",0
To small,1
I was so disappointed. The picture showed a nice pinkish flesh tone for the udder. The costume I received had a gray unattractive udder. I use costumes for my business and this is unacceptable to show a picture and substitute something else...bait & switch.,1
Ordered a large tall; way too big. I had to send it back.,1
$45 for a product that probably cost $2.50 to make.  The stickers on it are peeling off.  Really bad odor inside.  The clips that push in together to hold it together were very bent and required me to pry them back into shape before the helmet snaps in place.  The black visors in the picture are misleading.  The visor color on mine was a yellowish see through material.  Very hard to see out of.  I'll definitely need to get the glue out to hold the helmet together and restick the peeling stickers.  When it arrived it looked like it had been open before.  There was tape holding parts of the plastic together.  Is it worth $45? No way.  Will it work?  Yes.  But don't get your hopes up about this.  Overall it's pretty junky.,1
"Although I do not hate these shoes they are not what i ordered!These shoes are very HOT.  Its almost like they are insulated with GoreTex, although there is no mention of this on the shoe or in the box.  I live in Alaska and still find them uncomfortably warm.  I do not think i will be able to wear during the summer....  the product description state ""Breathable Mesh Upper - A highly breathable upper also built with synthetic upper for greater durability.""The shoe box that was delivered lists the color as ""Dusty Olive"" whereas the product description lists them as  ""Black"".These are not Chameleon ""Stretch"", they have laces that require tying though the description states ""4-Way Stretch Collar"" and the photos do show the laces tied.  That was my over site, but still frustrating...",1
They should be ashamed to have this on the market. I may cut it apart and use it as a template to fabricate my own. And the way the box came in was terrible.... No care at all was put in shipping... At least bubble wrap it. It was just put in the box and shipped.,0

It doesn't. you're just really uncomfortable. I had a pair when i was a size 4 and needed to smooth out a few lines and suck in my tummy a bit and, yes, it did the trick then. but at size 12, now, forget about it - the teeny weeny bit it helps just doesn't make the pain worth it.",1
I purchased it with expedited shipping and the estimated delivery time was stated as the day before Halloween. It arrived a few days after Halloween and it arrived smashed in.  Cheap Product.  They need to fill it with something so it can hold its shape.  If you order this do not sit down on it or you will crush it.,0
I knew this wasn't an actual clock but assumed it was an actual full piece plastic heart. I expected junk..i got worse. DO NOT WASTE YOUR $! Its not rounded. Its a thin piece of plastic like the material a flat cake topper is made of. You can make this cheaper and more durable on youf own. Im extremely disappointed even just for a kids costume.,1
Not sure if these are genuine converse. Shoes came mangled with dirty shoelaces as if they were already worn by a 7 year old on a play date. Came back to this package after a month of touring. Wish I could return this garbage.,0
does not fit well - for some reason i pop out the bottom on the right side - I even tried a larger size and had the same problem even though the larger size was too big (which I returned),1
Product didn't come with any box which makes wonder if it's original or fake. Printing inside the trunk was slanted & blurred.,0
For me the stone was much larger than I would have liked... I was looking for a much smaller necklace... Too large looks too fake..,0

Just received the time.  It is most certainly fake.  I don't know how Amazon allows this fake item be sold here.  The watch is defective.  The Seconds and Minute sub-dials do not work.  very disappointed.  This is the first time i have experienced fake item on amazon. See the genuine product photo that says 200 meters under the name Invicta. The fake item i just got does not say 200 meters.  Genuine back side has a large Invicta wings logo.  fake item received from amazon does not have invicta lot on the back.  Also see the sub-dials reversed on fake.Genuine invicta watch pics are attached with this review.,0
"It looks nice on the picture... but what I've receive was a really dusty wallet, spiderwebs and everything. I got my leather cleaning and cleaned that off, made sure there wasn't any actual spiders inside and then I started filling it w. cards. At first when I attempted to place my ID on the first compartment, I thought it was stuck together because of the amount of time  that it might've been on storage, I tried.. with my very own ID, to separate  each part, this caused for the plastic  that protects the ID  while showcasing it to come off! to put all my other cards in it, was a battle, I finally got them in but now the wallet keeps on ""popping"" open and every time I'm looking for something on my purse I find this thing wide open all my cards showing, me feeling disappointed.",0

"I expected the costume to be made of fabric, but it is made of thin material, almost like foam/paper, and does not look durable.  The hat is even thinner (like surgery cap).  It's fine for an evening of trick or treat and for pictures.  My son seems to like it.",1
"I have been wanting a breast reduction for probably as long as I can remember (I'm 43).  Being cursed with an apple body shape and after kids...well the girls have become more troublesome than ever and really are ""in the way"". I ride horses and compete and my instructor had finally mentioned that I really needed something to tame my DD's. And I couldn't agree more!!!  I have tried **everything**, and a good ""stabilizing"" bra is not something I would cut corners on and buy ""cheap"" (those of you with big girls like mine, know that function supersedes beauty and price every time).  I ordered a size 4 as recommenced for my 42DD.  Put it on...which is a major chore, but I certainly did not care about that one bit.  All it achieved for me was create  a large bouncing ""mass"" in front of me. Did NOTHING to control bounce. It was actually horrifying.  I hate a uni-boob- but could live with that if it stabilized and prohibited bounce.  No such luck at all.  It was actually worse.  This huge clumping-bouncing blob in my front looked hideous and offered no function at all. Not what I would have expected from a bra at this price point, advertising what it claims. I guess being short wasted combined with full busted= beyond control.",1
Sizing chart isn't correct. If your on last peg for size go ahead and buy size up. I'm 5'2 130. So should be AB right? Nope there tight as heck hardly wearable. Really should've read reviews. As barely there is much much darker than the picture.,1
This is not a real Carhartt hat!!! The picture shown is false advertisement!!! Do not be fooled this hat is a fake!,0

"The shoes fit great, however, I own 3 other pair of Cole Haan Trillby, and the leather is of higher quality. This pair of Trillby has a non-sturdy, soft leather, that will not last, in my opinion. I'm hoping that these are authentic Cole Haan's and not fake.",0
This custome only last the Halloween night. My son loves it but I have to sew it a lot of times.,1
I used the customer reviews on this shoe to select a size larger than I would normally select and learned to my dismay that by selecting a larger size I could almost turn around in the shoe. After exchanging the shoes for a smaller size they are still too big and in addition they 'just don't feel right.' I am returning the shoes for a refund.,1
I thought this plus size 3x/4x would be longerThis pair fits as well as stockings I've purchased from Claire's i did not buy the next size up bc i don't weigh 220 lbs,1
The shoe is completely different from the ones you get in store. This seems to be fake. My wife wears size 7 and she ordered 7.5 still it was small. My daughter has a size 7 at home and that fits much comfortably then this one. Had to return it.,0
"I purchased this - as an adult female, the fit is pretty close, my nose is squished and i can not wear my glasses.  In addition the interior is not well finished (dripping looking plastic) and contains no padding. the helmet is uncomfortable and does not sit right on my head.",1
"Polyester blend!  Why is the material not fully described in the product description or on the box? My guess is because cotton blends do not do well with water absorption and most people know that. They just kind of smear it around. If you are intending to use them for oil based materials like furniture polish, they would work, but nothing re-places 100% cotton.Immediately returned mine.",1
"While I loved the look and the brand, the watches I ordered did not work. The first one would not work and I took it to a jeweler to see if the battery was bad. The battery was good, but the watch still did not work. I returned it for another. I set the time on the second watch and then the minute hand was broken. It would swing around on the watch and not tell time. I gave up and went to a retail store to buy another watch. Not sure if the watches were real or possibly fake. The company did accept returns promptly and credit my account for the purchase. Just can't believe I had two bad watches in a row.",0
"I tried on the stockings and was about to head out the door, when I put on my shoes and noticed a run on my foot.

I can maybe get away with wearing this under looser things, but the pointy boobs will NOT be coming out under anything form-fitting or in the workplace. I was an idiot and ripped the tags off, as other bras from this brand in my size (32dd) have fit well. Learn from my mistake!",1

"Buyer beware is in order, I suppose. It was too good to be true that my size in these boots were on sale and had everything I wanted in a work boot.  Well, I was lied to. The product description clearly stated these boots had Moisture managing mesh linings, which they did not, and did not state that they had a steel toe, which they do. I did not want a steel toe and I was very much interested in the mesh lining, so were it not for the fact that they actually fit very well, and I'm just sick and tired of looking for good-fitting work boots, I would be returning them. So I'm conflicted. They fit well and I don't want to go through the hassle of returning them, but they're not what I ordered, hence the very low rating. But if you don't want some of the features clearly stated in the product description, these are still pretty good boots.",1
These are classic fake black market CK underwear.  The label was really crude and they were incredibly small for a medium US size.  Very thin material as well.  Do not buy.  You will be disappointed. I will never buy clothing again on Amazon.  Plus 22 bucks for one pair!!!!  Zero stars!!!,0

"I've been ordering these socks for a couple of years from Amazon.  They've been good everyday 100% cotton socks.  The shipment that arrived just a few days ago was NOT 100% cotton and was in fact almost a 50% synthetic blend.  I'm sure this is due to the fact that cotton has gone from 65 cents a pound to more than $1.00 a pound in the last few months so they are trying to cut costs.  However the product description still says 100% cotton and the product is NOT.  I guess one benefit of the synthetic blend is they will hold their color longer.  I thought it was funny that there was a sticker on the package that said something like ""new eco fiber.""  Since when is polyester, which is made from oil, an eco fiber?  I mean, these things aren't made of hemp!So if you like 100% cotton socks, these are not the socks for you anymore.",1

"i purchased these boots for my brother a while back because he only wears Timberlands and couldn't find his size in the local store in our country. they arrived well packaged and all but after a few months of wearing them (total of about 12 wearings) he had he strangest complain in all his time as a Tims fan: the body came loose from the sole!!! so that looking down at the boots your could see a crease all the way round-on both boot.he has never before had this problem and we have concluded that these are quite likely fake :(i definitely wouldnt recommend these to anyone- 'cept to say ""dont buy these""",0
"Dissappointed.  Narrow as stated and fit is okay.  But not shaped well.  No support in arch at all.  Don't care for the all synthetic materials.  What looks like a suede sandal, is lined in a synthetic stiff material that is stitched to the fake suede.  Hard and not forgiving.  I have a bad ankle and pronate due to FLAT feet.  Thought these would be great. Look like Fitflops I have and these came narrow.....These are going back...Darn.!",0
These shoes are fake!  The cut is awful and noticeably different between shoes. And no 'by Marciano' under the Guess logo inside the shoe.  Beware!!,0
the shoe is not leather it is made in china if you buy these know that it is not it says they are fake.,0

Just like most of the other reviewer's immediately after opening my new clutch the inside clasp broke in such a way that makes it impossible to close completely. I don't trust it to put anything in it so I have to get rid of it.,1
Fit was not good,1
"The product looks good and sturdy!  HOWEVER, one has to have wooden feet (or feet made of steel) in order to feel comfortable while wearing these clogs!  There is NO cushioning inside the clogs and no flexibility whatsoever!  Even wearing a pair of heavy duty socks doesn't help much!",1
"I ordered this dress and received an entirely different one. It is still Glinda but has ugly butterflies on it and the sleeves are too small to get on. I am 5'11"" so I thought maybe it was just me, but I had my 5'6"" extremely petite sister try it and couldn't get the elastic (that is to go around your BICEP) past her wrist.RIDICULOUS.

"Good looking shoe but it's not as described on the website. Website says leather upper but on the tongue it says ""Leather with man made upper"". Then below it ""Leather lining"". That tells me that the upper is NOT leather. After walking around in them for, like, 10 minutes, I noticed the creases on top of the shoe verified that it wasn't leather. Overall fit was not that great either. I'm going to return these and pay a little bit more for Johnston & Murphy brand shoes.",1
"i love the product line in general and have black, taupe, dark brown, etc.  i bought these for summer use with lighter colors pants and clothes.  BIG mistake, the get very dirty very fast, show every spot and will not easily clean.  this is why i gave it one star.  if the light color and easy stain does not bother you, get the product.",1
"I can't say i'm surprised by my experience.  Like all of the costumes you can find in any box store, these one piece polyester costumes are hot, uncomfortable and not practical for children.  My daughter wears a 5 in almost everything, the 4-6 is too small.  The best part of the costume is the hat.  I'm going to make my daughter's costume from jeggings and a white long sleeve T and a good trip to the fabric store (rhymes with mo-ann's).  The hat is going to be tricky but not so much that i would consider keeping this costume.  Back it goes!  I made my son's Woody costume 6 years ago, it was adorable.",1
"I have purchased many pairs of Chucks over the years and was pretty disappointed with this pair. Within weeks the bottoms of the shoes started detaching, and the left shoe had already worn through on the bottom. At first I thought it was because of my job where I am constantly on my feet. Based on the many reviews here stating these are fakes, I ordered another pair directly from Nike/Converse and the new pair did not have the same problems.I cannot say for certain that these are fakes. I've previously purchased pairs from Amazon that lasted years and never had a reason to suspect they were anything but legitimate Converse. In the future, however, I will purchase directly from Nike/Converse.",0
I bought these in black and was so disappointed. They had several small snags in them just from putting them on. Very disappointing because otherwise they look good and are soft.,1

It looks like they took their average size width and just stamped it EE.  The other thing is the quality is way below the previous Justin boots that I have owned, which were made in the USA.  These look like some cheap knock offs made in Mexico.",1

"I was a little mislead in the sizing info so ordered the medium for my 4-year old grandson.  The costume is way too large for him!  Guess I'll have to wait for him to grow into it!  Also, for the price I paid ($20.93), I think the costume is very cheaply made.  There were lots of loose threads and the sleeves are not hemmed.  The way the cape is attached at the neck doesn't work well -- small pieces of velcro barely sewn on and it is uncomfortable the way it meets the neckline.  One other detriment to the costume, the belt is very flimsy and you have to tie it each time in the back --with a bow (??)  I don't think Superman would approve.",1
"I think the main problem I have with this product is that it was not as advertised. You can find several listings for this shoe, and they are not consistent in the description. The one I used failed to mention that the material on top of the shoe looks and feels like a very strange fake/rough suede. It has an odd appearance of being used even when new. I did not like it, which is why I gave it the two star ""I don't like it"" rating. Any picture of the Rex Slip-On that gives it the appearance of real leather is misleading.",0
Maybe the credit card pockets will eventually loosen up but it was extremely difficult to get the cards in most of the slots.  A credit card is a credit card....all the same size.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the card compartments bigger.  I am already dreading when I have to pull a card out to use for a purchase. I would not buy again nor recommend this product unless your credit cards are skinnier than mine!,1

"This is the second Buxton wallet I have purchased over the last 3 months and neither one work as well as my old workhorse Buxton wallet of 15 years. I just went back to the oldest wallet because it holds the all of the cards I need, is smaller in the purse, and fits into my pocket when I want it to. The oldest one is much more efficient. The problem with this wallet is that I could only fill the credit card area partially because they got too tight and the flap would not buckle. I could not put too many bills in the wallet and less than a dollar in change because the clasp would not connect. After less than a month of use I was totally frustrated. Then one day one of the clasps on the change part broke off. I paid nearly $35 for this wallet and no longer use it. It looks great, but is not functional. I am back to my original Buxton, a bit beat up, but extremely functional. It holds more than either of the larger wallets I purchased. I love the zipper design.",1

"I loved my original Smart Clip, but lost it. Obviously, so do a lot of other people, which has led to a number of knock-offs being sold, this one included.  Amazon Customer Service gave me money back, but as an increasing number of Amazon listings come from third-party vendors, ""buyer beware"" will only increase.The product itself was horrible. It was cut incorrectly, leaving sharp metal edges that would rip the inside of your pocket. Plus. it has scratches all over it on both sides, as if it had been used by someone before. Finally, there was no patent pending number on it like my old original had. As for the packaging, it was sealed, and at a glance looked legit.  However on further inspection, it was easy to see it was fake: no UPC barcode, the pictures were blurry and not sharp, and just generally flimsy.There are a lot of people looking for the original Smart Clip, meaning there are a lot of people search for it, meaning many vendors will try to make these fakes to grab the business. I don't know why they stopped making the originals, but in any case don't waste your money on this one.",0

"I ordered the size 32/34 and it was way to big and riding up. There was obvious gapping in the back where it didn't even touch my skin. Seems the sizing runs large. Aside from the sizing being very off, it did seem good quality and soft. I would say the size small fits more like a 36.",1
"I purchased these shoes back in mid-December for about $50 dollars all told. About two weeks in, after only having worn them a few times, the loop on the tongue that the laces are thread through unattached on one side. I didn't think much of it as it's not crucial to the shoes overall wearability. Now, about two and a half months in of what I'd consider to be normal wear, both of the soles have detached from the shoe on the outer front side. Having owned more than a dozen pairs of converse over the years, I can say this is not the quality I expect from this brand. I'm extremely dissatisfied and will NOT be re-purchasing from this retailer.",1
"Not sure if authentic. Came in a baggie and not a box. Daughter also just noticed one shoe is missing a rivet, and only wore twice!",0
size chart must indicate that they are bigger than regular size for woman. they are one size bigger,1

"ordered on the 21st with a 2 day free delivery from Amazon Prime, 2 came on December 30th, the 3rd one on Jan 2.  The intended recipients had already gone home so the desired effect didn't work!",0
They're fake. I returned them. Went to sunglasses hut. Got real ones. Road off into the sunset on a unicorn wearing sunglasses I was certain had 100% UV protection.,0
I would not recommend it no matter how appealing.,1
"The product description ""2 of Thorlo Women's Experia Micro-Mini Crew Sock"" is a little misleading. We thought we were purchasing 2 pairs, but only received one. The ""Question & Answer"" section of the page erroneously said this is for 2 pairs too.",1
"As the saying goes "" you get what you pay for"". Cheap, cheap.....quality",1
"I believe these are fake raybans.  Bought from Jami Mcllough, fulfilled by amazon.  No sticker on the box indicating what make or size the glasses are, no lens sticker on the lens, the insert was for the wayfarer model, not aviator, and I could not read the information on the inside arms of the glasses.",0
"I like the idea of this wallet.  Lots of pockets, which is what I wanted, and what looked like ample room.  Unfortunately, the largest pouch (in the top) is only secured with velcro, and that is just not something I would want to put things like a passport or important docs into.  I gave it to my friends' kid to play with.",1
I don't see the same quality as my older boots of the same manufacture . The exterior finish does not have a dress boot shine .The fit is somewhat tight and is the same size I always order but ...guess I will keep em and hope they get better as they are broken in.Maybe they will get better as they are worn,1
"I bought this since the reviews were so good.  I have NO idea why people like this jacket.  I wanted something close to the field jacket I had in the Marines in the 70's and 80's.  I didn't expect it be be exact, but it's not even in the ballpark.  The pockets are small, it has a completely different feel, it's much lighter weight, (almost like burlap) and comes with the dog tag, velcro above the pockets and red tag on the left breast pocket.  If you are looking for the real thing, you will be disappointed in this fake-looking (and feeling) jacket.  Finally, I ordered one size too small, as everyone said they run big.  I am a 2XL so I ordered an XL.  It is snug without a liner; I won't be able to use a liner or wear anything other than a tee shirt under it.  (I am above-average in size; 6'2"", 270, 52"" chest, 42"" waist.)  Should have ordered the 2XL.  I guess tight clothes are fashionable now, but this jacket was meant to be worn with a liner, over a uniform.  Spend the extra bucks and get the real thing, (or the closest thing, which is made by Alpha) and avoid this goofy knock-off.",0
"If I could give these a ""0"", I would. The product I received does not look like the picture on the web site. There is no ""Oakley"" etched into the lens and it doesn't say ""made in the U.S.A."" On the ear piece. I'm pretty sure these are fake. Going to purchase them on Oakley's web site. Definitely not paying $190 for cheap fakes!!!!!!",0
"I only got one shoe.  Correct size though (mens size).  But it came with scuffs, which shows up on white rubber.",1
"This arrived quickly, but is only a t-shirt with a cape attached to the back by velcro. It is not a jumpsuit as stated in the description. Perhaps we received this shipment in error, but my son needs this for school asap, so no time to exchange.",0
"It did not fit, meaning it was more a child's size than adult.  Looked as if it had been manufactured in a hurry & paint slapped on it.  Sadly you really get what you pay for.",1
"When I opened the box this morning and took the top pair of hose out, it was inside out and had a BIG hole in them.  Not happy about that!  The second pair was fine.  These are hard to find in any stores.",1
These were not true to size. My daughter said they were tight.,0
Made in India!!!!It seems fake one ?,0
"I thought that these would be kind of like cut-off control top panty hose. They're more like just cut-off regular pantyhose. There was no 'control' at all in the 4 pair I bought, following their sizing charts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find them too tight, in fact I thought they'd be tighter. Regular firm control briefs are better. Waste of money.",1
Ripped within 1 hour of wearing them. Didn't even notice snagging them and then all of a sudden there was a huge tear all the way up the leg.,1
"This should specify that is for kids , way too small.",1
"The cup was too large, and the circumference was too small.  I find this amazing because this is the size of bra I have on right now.  How do I return it? The bra itself looks good and seems to be a good product but the size is way off.",1
"The product description and photos are misleading. I thought I would be receiving 3 slim packing cubes of the same size, but it's actually 3 different sizes. The smaller 2 are too small to pack many clothes, except maybe a few pairs of underwear. I reordered thinking it was maybe just a mistake, but the same thing happened. I will be sending these back.",1
"Cheap one-sided plastic accessory. No alternatives, but you are not much of a lion without it so...I bought it, and it worked.",1
"I purchased a pair of size 10 Brooklyn Boots. I usually get a 10, or 101/2 so I was surprised when these were way too big. I got some insoles, and that helped a little. I just read the product description again, and this boot is supposed to have a full liner, the pair I have has no liners. Is this the problem? Can the problem be fixed?I also have a pair, of Eastlend Blue Steel, and Hi Fidelity. Those both have full liners, and fit well.Can you help?",1
"hated, didn't fit, looked fake, felt cheap and plastic. tried on once, sent back next day. not Laredo quality at all",0
Cheap looking and didn't look as expected. The wig only covered half the head. I returned it.,1
"This costume was really junk.  Total polyester with an evil smell.  The cape is just cut from a piece of cloth with no stitching and the Velcro to hold it on the costume is stingy and cheap.  The colors are not as shown.  And, even if they were, I would not put this on my grandson to wear all day long, which he would want to do, because that is way too much polyester to put on a child for more than an hour.",1

"I've had this set of slippers for about a month.  They are comfortable, particularly at first.  They are still okay but the sewing on the right shoe which attaches the rubber sole to the shoe is coming out.  i noticed a loose thread a couple of weeks ago but I didn't think anything of it.  I trimmed it and forgot it. Today I'm looking at it and almost the entire side of that shoe is coming unsewn.  Of course, the return date for the shoes is past by a few days.  If you get these, be sure you check the sewing closely before the return date (30 days after delivery) is past.",0
Not comfortable .. I think it's fake,0
Very difficult to understand how to order this for a girl. We ended up with a shoe that was way too large. Girls are very into converse shoes right now. The sellers need to allow for the sizing for male and female. Very disappointed granddaughter when they didn't fit.,1
Incredibly scratchy and snagged either out of package or when putting on first time.,1
"Hi ,Me and my friend gifted this to a groom in an wedding in las vegas , we are so embarrassed that it was a fake and it does not even shows correct time but still tried to convince my self but my friend observed  that  minutes mark is detached from board (dial) and moving inside the watch , I am big fan of amazon This is the first time we are ashamed of amazon . I know that it is not fault with amazon but the seller was Authentic Watch Store  !!! which is only Authentic in name I guessPlanning to return !!! be aware ALERT!!I still have all the  picture taken by wedding photographer in high def , :(:([...]",0
Count me in as a potential customer who gets turned away by way too many negative reviews. If this Levi's product store is a fake Amazon should remove it asap. Else if it stays on then it's obviously REAL Levi's. In that case let all customers vote with their wallet.Levi's is out of my mind now. I'm going for other quality upstart denims.,0
"Unfortunately this Halloween accessory didn't last long at all. The little twigs started coming out the moment we took it out of the box, so I kept it out of reach from the kids until Halloween day. After two Halloween events, the vast majority of the broom's ""brushes"" had fallen out. It's a very cute broom, just poorly made. A crafty person might be able to make it last longer if they owned a hot glue gun, but that's beyond my personal abilities.",1
"The hate was to big. It look as if it was fake, in my searching I'm was looking for a real Black Fedora Hat, this is not what I was looking for.",0

"I have three rotations now of getting two washings and one wearing out of these shirts before they begin to develop holes in various area of the shirt.  I purchased these thinking that the heavier weight cotton would be far more durable than your normal, run-of-the-mill pocketed t-shirts.  These are hands down the lowest quality t-shirts I have ever owned.  I have no frills Jockey shirts that have taken years of abuse from wearing and washing, that have never developed the holes these t-shirts do.  And don't get me wrong, I am a Carhartt fan.  Have been for over 20 years.  I wanted to like these shirts, but they are horrible.  I'll give credit to Carhartt.  They have replaced 4 shirts for me now over three separate defective return claims, but who wants to spend their time calling in each month for a return claim.Carharrt's quality department needs to up their game.  I have two returns coming to me in a week or so.  If those shirts do the same thing, I'm asking for my money back and looking for shirts elsewhere.  This is just sad.",1
" i thought would kind like cut-off control top panti hose .they 're like cut-off regular pantyhos .there 'control ' 4 pair i bought , follow size chart .unlik review , i n't find tight , fact i thought 'd tighter .regular firm control brief better .wast money .",1
Terrible quality. Didn't expect much but the photo looks nothing like the actual product. Avoid,1
"The quality of the bra and fit are fine, but too often it peeks out when wearing tops that are cut in a v-neck or even some scoop-necks.  My clothing choices aren't particularly racy so it's bothersome that even a normal top would show the bra.  Mostly, I only wear the bra if I'm certain it won't show.",1
The description for this sneaker clearly shows-  Size: US Men's 6 = US Women's 8. That's the size I was looking for but when it arrived it turned out to be a Men's 4. I shipped it all the way to the Caribbean and by the time it arrived it was too late to return it.,1
"Although they may look pretty authentic, they are not. Nose piece fell off first day, took them to an authentic dealer for repair, they verified that these were fake.",0

"These earrings were too big, looked gaudy, cheap and fake. Good for costume jewelry maybe?",0
I won't buy another Invicta product. Sparkly junk. A tiny quartz movement with an even tinier battery. Was dead within three months of delivery. Fools gold,0
"KSwiss stopped making the Defier line, which was a fabulous shoe.  Great fit, great support, great ventilation, etc.  I was referred to the Ultrascendor as a replacement for the Defier, but I don't really care for the shoe.  Unfortunately, I bought two pair.  I don't feel the same support, my feet sweat much more, and the material seems flimsy compared to the Defier.  I've got to seek out a different shoe.  They look pretty good and are an OK shoe, but definitely not as good as the Defier.",1
"I've worn Rainbow Sandals for years and have always bought them directly from the company web site. This time, I purchased them on Amazon so as to take advantage of Amazon Prime and have them here before our family vacation. They arrived right on time, but there is something very odd about them: Instead of the entire bottom being covered with the non-slip rubber, only strips of it are covered, and the rest is strips of soft felt (see photo). This felt won't last a minute on the hot LA pavement! I am guessing these are (a) defective or (b) fake Rainbows -- unless this felt-looking bottom is a new thing that I'm just not aware of? Some strange new species of hemp? Now begins the process of returning them; no sandals for vacation after all. What a bummer (but first-world problems, I know). I've learned my lesson and will buy direct from the company web site in the future.",0
received package and the rayban box is old ripped and open then took glasses out and they look fake the rb etching is on outside instead of the inside and don't seem of rayban quality and the paper on the end of the box that has the serial number and what not is covered with a sticker that says new im going to be returning,0
"Stars rating is actually 0 but It would not allow me to put that! These are fake! Not real havaianas. I also bought a pair from a reputable high street store in the USA and they are completely different. The size is different, the thickness of the sole and the brand stamp are all different to a genuine pair! Don't buy them! I also want my money back!",0
"I bought this after reading all of the rave reviews and was very disappointed.  I am 5'9 and 135 lbs, normally a size 4 to 6 with an average bust size.  The top was completely unflattering as it smashed down what I do have to make me look flat.  Maybe fake boobs would look better in it, as they are ""unsmashable."" I had no trouble figuring out how to put it on, and the material seemed fine for the purpose.  The bottoms fit a little better, and look sexy, but the straps do dig in a little if you have any tummy at all.  A total waste of $17 for this in my opinion. I gave it two stars because of the bottoms; i plan to ""make it work"" somehow instead of dealing with the return process.",0
"This shirts are fake, I bought 4 of them, and this is what I received. A Gildan and other China shirt whit the Lacoste painted. ????",0

"Sorry I grew up wearing All Stars!!!!!!!!yes it has been along time but these are not any where near what the old ones were. The canvas is paper thin and they look and feel cheap the things are like BOZO SLIPPERS! and they are not too big, how can a Company allow this to happen amazes me. Chuck would not have signed off on these sneakers. Its i shame the young folks don't know the difference. I'm really wondering if i got fake ones they say made in India is that normal?. I don't know, what i do know is I'm disappointed! in this pair of sneakers. The seller did a good job getting them out which is awesome very fast shipping, maybe i'm just getting OLD!!WOW! I just checked e-bay there's some used ORIGINAL one's for 200.00 or 300.00 bucks",0

I was really excited to get these boots (and delighted with the 2 day (regular delivery!) span between placing my order and getting the boots. But I was SO disappointed that the boots didn't fit! The leather was so tough so as to feel like it was actually fake and it was super inflexible. Also - the width was surprisingly narrow (especially for Dansko). All in all - I suggest trying these on in a store before buying. Am going to get the Sonja clogs in black instead (I already know how well they fit).,0

Only reason why it has one star is because you can't give it 0 stars.  Super cheap looking the only loud crack thing about it is the product description on Amazon.  And there is no way this is real leather.  This is false advertisement.,1

"I've had this watch for maybe 6 month now.I bought it simply because it was made of titanium and looked good, and I get metal allergy from anything else.  I first had a black skagen mesh watch, but it was not 100% titanium, and started to give me a rash when the paint wore off. This one is perfect however. I use it every day. It has gotten one nick in the crystal. It is my first watch ever not to give me a rash.I also have received questions like, ""Is that watch something special?"". So I guess it must look good.Update, I have to downgrade this watch. I have owned 3 Skagen watches now, and while they look OK, they are not made for every day use. On one the clamp eventually broke off, and the glass broke very easily on another (and the first one was far from hypoallergenic).  The clamp is  design issue. The band kept opening after even the lightest bump with the hand. Only way to get it to sit was to bend the clamp in slightly to increase the tension. But titanium is too brittle to bend well, so eventually, some months later it just snapped off. keep it on  At the price I'd expect something that last a few years.  Unfortunately there are not a lot of affordable options out there.  Ideally, there should be a watch with a soilicone strap, and a titanium body.",1

read all the nasty reviews. still i went ahead to buy  for the sake of curiosity.undeniably i loved and respected the brand.i can accept and understand how they  made it lighter/thinner this time....but what's disturbing with the Levi's i got are the craftsmanship....how the stitches were. 2 major horrible things I sadly noticed...1.) the stiches along side the pants( the entire length of the thigh area ...which is the outer side of the pants...the stitches were horribly loose.i have to take it to a tailor the next day to have it reinforced. my girlfriend keep telling me maybe It was a fake...but i am convinced with amazon's items.i mean if it's sold by them.i trusted Amazon. i still feel they're not knockoffs even though they scream of being one. 2.) i don't know the technical name...or what to call it. the bottom edge of the pants. my old levi's and even the photos on amazon....showed a somewhat right amount of fold.(am talking about the very bottom edge of the pants where it touches your feet) the folds on the Levi's that i got are so crazy thin.its about a quarter of an inch...as opposed to maybe half an inch...if we base on the photos and the old levi's that i have. this is when i started to feel cheated.the loose stitches i blame on the quality control or maybe the guy in Haiti who did the pants had a bad day. but the bottom fold is really disappointing and its not the same as shown in the pictures. To say the least this is were Amazon should be responsible enough to set buyer's expectations based on the photos they show.,0
"So the arches are really hard and pronounced, and they are not the same on each foot, another reviewer said he had a defective left shoe, well I think I got the matching right side.  I've been trying to stick it out for a week, even directly putting my heel and all my weight on the arch to try and ""break it in"" but it's not budging and I'm going to end up limping if I try to keep it up. The first day I wore them, it took me a couple of days for my arch to recover, I thought I had just hit it wrong or something.The styling and design of the shoe is great, so it is disappointing that it is not comfortable, I really wanted to like these shoes, I guess I'll see if I can send them back because they are defective.",0

"I opened the package expecting the ""FREE 1x SWG Deluxe clam shell case & FREE 1x SWG MICRO FIBER CLOTH,"" as stated in the product description. I was quite disappointed to discover that the ""Deluxe clam shell case"" is nothing more than a clunky, oversized glasses case made out of flimsy plastic pieces, hot-glued together. It started to melt in the less than 90 degree weather. The ""Micro fiber cloth"" is a very thin square of fabric. It seems like it would sooner scratch the glasses than clean them. The glasses themselves at first looked to be decently fashionable, yet upon further inspection I realized that only one nose pad was attached. Additionally, the glasses did not come with a screw to attach the second nose pad. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.",1

"I purchased this hoodie in Large and that is usually my size (i am 5'8 and chest size 42"") but its a bit large on me. As mentioned on a sweater I purchased from this brand as well on Amazon, it is important to have a size chart of your shirts with the measurements your brand fits people since we (the customers) are obviously purchasing this online and thats how we can manage ourselves, instead the size chart offered is the generic Amazon size chart, which isn't as detailed as can be. The material is thin and as mentioned in the product description is ideal for layering over a long sleeve shirt which is fine, and it looks like it be great, just not in my size. I would recommend to definitely buy a size smaller than what you usually wear to have it look like it does on the gentleman in the main image. The average customer I am sure has the option to return and change the size (I am currently outside of the country, ordered it to a friend's house who brought it down for me, so yeah I have a much harder task of returning), but hopefully that can all be avoided if the brand can place a more exact size chart of their shirts.",1

Dont waste your money. It looks like it would be a good accessory for your costume but its just a light weight piece of plastic you safety pin to your costume. I could of homemade one that looked more convincing.,1
"I own more watches than I need, but I'm always in the market for another.  Saw and guy wearing one of these and I said I thought that was a nice looking watch.  He said, thanks, it's an Invicta.  So I started looking at this brand.  Holy cow, an automatic watch for $100?  I'm in.This is a handsome watch.  It's got a bold design and I like its heavy, masculine steel band.  Looks good on my wrist.But on closer inspection, it's got about the same fit and finish as a fake, Tijuana Rolex.  The machining is clumsy.  For example, it's got a screw-down crown (good), but the knob is rough, the tension spring is too stiff, and you have to futz with it to make the threads match up when screwing it down.  The clasp is thin stamped metal, and again, you need to futz with it to get it to line up before it will snap shut.I'm not comparing this to real Rolexes or Omegas.  Never owned one of those.  I'm comparing it to watches in its list price range; Seikos and Wengers and Citizens.  A $150 Seiko has far better quality than this Invicta.I'm going to keep this and put it in the rotation.  I'll wear it to work periodically.  But if I was looking for a daily driver, this wouldn't be it.  You can get the same quality for less, or a much better watch for not much more.  For such a cheap watch, $100 is actually pretty expensive.",0

"I have owned quite of few pairs of new balance sneakers and all of them have been very comfortable. However, lately it seems everyone I buy are made different now.

The only positive to this shoe is that it still looks very nice, other than that they feel terrible.

I complained when I felt them and then my wife went back and looked closer at the product description and found that they were only 60% wool blend.  How much wool that is I have no ideanot much.  After one wearing, I gave them to my kids for sock puppets.  There are much nicer ones at Sams Club.",1
"It only took 4 days since I ordered this here in Amazon. I was hesitant at first to buy a watch on line especially Seiko watches knowing there are a lot of fake ones circling around. But still gave it a try since I can't find anything around my area with this kind and with this prize? I gave it a try. It came with very good packaging including its original box and papers inside. The first thing I checked if it's really an automatic watch. I hate battery operated watches! It seemed look original to me and when I compared it online it also matches with the product descriptions and its numbers. It has ""MALAYSIA MOVEMENT KY"" written on the transparent cover at the back of the watch. I checked it online to confirm its authenticity. Just checking... I bought this for work and fits really well. I gave it 4 stars for the ""MALAYSIA"" written at the back. I like JAPAN better! All in all, I still like it!Update: November 17, 2013I noticed on the first week since I started wearing this watch it has been losing at least a minute after a couple of days. I haven't done anything to correct this but to adjust it every week (every Monday specifically when I get to work to synchronize it with the employee time recorder). I don't wanna call seiko or amazon about this minor issue after I read one of the reviewers here wrote that seiko doesn't recognize amazon as one of their sellers of their watches. I wrote this review just to let you guys know (based on my experience) about this product and maybe at least can help/inform others before deciding to buy this product. I still like the watch tho.It stopped working... (8/14/2014).",1

Sunglasses received from sunglass express were fake; box has a sticker that comes right off and no recycling logo. Box does not match the sunglasses that are sold. Arrived without any protective packaging on the glasses and they looked used (finger prints and smudging on lens).Brought the sunglasses in to a retailer and was confirmed they are fake; missing logo on nose bridge of the glasses and noticeable difference in rubber quality and hinges compared to authentic pair.Some people have not had this issue so might have gotten a fake pair from a previous return.,0

"The sandals I received were FAKES. I am very familiar with this brand I own some. The sandal I received wasn't even a good knock off. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in Amazon and these are going right back. (I have ordered shoes on Amazon many times and this has never happened before).Follow up: I contacted Amazon customer service and the representative told me that they purchased these sandals from the manufacturer. Well no way Jack Rogers was the manufacturer of these plastic/not leather sandals. I am receiving a refund but am very disappointed because I have never purchased anything from Amazon that I felt had been misrepresented until this point.Further Follow Up: I contacted the company Jack Rogers about this purchase and sent them pictures of the obviously fake plastic sandals. I heard back from them within 12 hours and although they did not sell me the shoe, Jack Rogers graciously offered to replace them with genuine Jack Rogers sandals at their expense stating that they very much cared that fakes were being sold but wanted me to be happy with my purchase. Buy your shoes directly from JackRogers!",0

"I just received this item, and was disappointed to learn that the dimensions and weight in the product description are incorrect.  It is 8 inches deep, not 5, and it definitely weighs more than 4 pounds.  The tag on the item says that it is 17 X 13 X 8 inches.  I don't have the exact weight, but it feels like more than 5 pounds.  I ordered this because I thought it would be smaller than the Delsey Helium Fusion 3.0, and I like that it has a shoulder strap.  If fact, it is larger than the 3.0.  In addition, it only has a partial zipper opening.  The 3.0 has a full zipper opening. I wish the 3.0 had a shoulder strap, but I still prefer it because it is smaller and more likely to fit under an airline seat, and it opens completely, making packing easier.  If size and weight are important to you, don't order this bag based on the dimensions presented above.",1

After putting all the items that I have in my existing wallet (that I have used for about 5 years) into this new wallet, the coin purse clasp would not stay closed.  I did have a item in just about every available slot in the wallet,  but did not have items in all of the pockets though.  I figure since the wallet is made with that many slots, I should be able to use all of them with no problem. I did like the amount of slots and pockets, but the problem with the clasp left me very disappointed in the product.",1

"I purchased these boots around Christmas.  I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around.  I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake.  The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them.  The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them.  The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight.  The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target.  The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin.  My mother took one look and said ""no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs.""  She is absouletly 100% correct.  So, the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different, there is no sticker on the box, the outside and inside quality are very poor, they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly, and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer's.  I'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again.  There is no comparing the items.  I don't like giving negative reviews because I've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store.",0

I had all my meds and essentials for an 11 hour flight removed from my sight because of the description if this product is off.

"I got a size 5X, which is outrageous as I am a 2X on most of my clothes if not a 1X. However, going by height & weight chart, I went with the suggested size. First off, the suggested is outrageous in making it so big for size that should be so much smaller! Today's clothing & fashion needs to boost a woman's confidence, not break her down! I've struggled with my weight since my last child & recent medical issues, I really needed these for a company holiday party. Oddly enough, even with such a big size, I had to fight to pull them up. They were so tight on my thighs that I had to take them off & wear pants under my flapper dress! I would NOT recommend this product!",1
This product is way to small for a toddler 4/6 years old. I would not image what the infant size would look like. Now I have to last minute go out to the stores and look for a costume for my son.

"I returned these. I made the decision to buy these Chuck Taylors after a couple of recommendations from different people. Well, they were totally uncomfortable for a number of reasons: NO support to the foot, the bottom of the shoe is flat, inside and outside. Also, too narrow - I have a wide foot but usually don't have problems with the width on sneakers since I can just loosen the laces if necessary. That didn't work on these - just too tight. Finally, the way the shoe is constructed, there are rough seams on the inside which started rubbing on my foot immediately, very unpleasant.",1

I love these tights they fit well and look great. The reason I'm giving two stars is because they tear VERY easily. Sometimes they'll tear as I'm putting them on for the first time. I would suggest going up one size to avoid this and making sure you're not wearing jewelry or wearing anything with edges as you're putting them on. I've tried putting clear nail polish on areas that sometimes look a little weak to prevent them from tearing. Otherwise they feel and look great.,1

I did not and found out quickly that it does not fit a below-average size 18-month old head (her head size is below average according to US head size/age charts)The product description reads:""- Child Small Toddler Infant Plush Fur-Trimmed Santa Hat- Toddler's and Child's Christmas Santa Claus Costume Accessory!- Standard Size for Toddler's and Child- Included in this posting: Deluxe plush red velvety 17"" circumference Santa Claus hat with white fur trim as featured. If you're looking for a hat to fit ""Toddler's and Child"", this hat won't fit (unless perhaps your child has a very, very small head).  The fact that the words ""Child"" and ""Toddler"" appear 3 times each in the description might confuse you as it did me.  This hat is most likely to fit an Infant (word appears once in the description).Separately, the outside appearance/quality of the hat is fine, but the inside quality (as describe in the other post) is not soft, but rather scratchy.",1

"Not even a day and already a buckle strap popped off.....did not come loose....it popped right off from both sides. Very poor quality and stiff soles. Additionally, the zipper tends to catch towards the bottom where the fake straps are. It is an altogether mediocre pair and I doubt it will last. If you choose to buy it, purchase a half size larger and invest in gel soles/inserts. The boots are like walking to on plywood and the flimsy zippers won't handle a snug fit so a bit of extra room from a half size up may help.",0

All I really care about is that it is a copy of the Rolex GMT Master, and that you have to be a slob to wear it. Here's a bit of helpful advice to someone considering buying this: save yourself some embarrassment, and save yourself the money. You will look foolish with Rolex GMT Master, and you will look even more ridiculous with a fake GMT Master. At least the Rolex has an in house mechanical movement! Don't get this, or the real deal. Buy a car instead, or a decent time piece, like a Jaeger Lecoultre or a Audemars Piguet.",0

"I wanted to love these as I love my other Ugg boots. I'm afraid these are knock offs or defects. I purchased from an Amazon seller in my usual size 10. When I received them, one boot was larger and wider than the other. The smaller one was extremely tight across the top of my foot. When I tried them on it was very unusual as one was too small and one was too big and floppy. And it had nothing to do with my feet. They were not even cut in the same shape on the foot area. While one looked like the correct shape although it was apparent it was not a size 10, the other was just a big non-shape, like a box shape- not a shoe shape. There were also strings coming out of all of the seams, and not from the intentional detailed seams. One also had a big scuff mark on top of the foot area. I am sad I had this experience and I am not sure if these were fake Uggs or if they were defects being sold without mention of it, but what a disappointment! So these had to be returned and although they provided a UPS label for me, I had to pay $10 for them to pick up from my house because we don't live near a UPS store. So trying on these sad excuses for Uggs cost me $10. What a rip off. Meanwhile I am still waiting on my refund!",0

"I was very disappointed with this ring.  Mainly for the fact that it has ""CHINA""  stamped in bold letter across the inside of the band. The gem stones looked very much fake and the overall weight of the ring didn't seem like real 925 silver. These are common things with Chinese rings,  however the product description claims it to be real,  so beware!  That aside,  the band was ridiculously thick and uncomfortable. The image doesn't show off how thick the band truly is. It's a shame though,  it's a very pretty design and I do have to say it shipped and I received it very fast. But if you're going to sell Chinese fakes I feel you should be more up front about it.",0

"Not the bag advertised!As many other reviewers have written, I was also seeking the ""Small Classic"" 6x9x17 as advertised.  I paid an extra $150+  to order the bag from The Jungle Store, because they specifically claimed to sell the much sought after Classic Small AmeriBag, 9"" wide.  Nine inches.But it's a fake out.  They shipped the newly designed 11"" wide bag that so many people have complained about. This really bothers me.  The Jungle Store must know that customers want the older, ""classic small bag"", and they used those magic words in their Amazon ad.  They also claimed 6x9x17 in the product description, quite incorrect.But they shipped me the much bigger, heavier, 11"" bag.My sweetie is a small woman who loves her old beat-up Small Classic Nylon AmeriBag.  I wanted to get her an updated beautiful leather replacement. Not to be.I noticed that other sellers had the larger redesigned leather AmeriBag for only $118.00, but they listed the real width of 11"".  So I foolishly bought the bag from The Jungle Store which claimed to have the bag in the more desirable 9"" wide size, paying over $150 more for the size I wanted.  They got my money.  And I do NOT have the bag I expected.As others have noted, this oversized bag is well made, good looking.  In my opinion the leather is slightly too thin to be the ""full grain"" leather, more likely a very nice ""top grain"" leather.  It is a really nice bag.  If only it were the real ""Small Classic"" bag.",1

"Perhaps mine was an anomaly, given so many positive reviews, but this bra was absolutely absurd! The band and underwire seemed good: very wide, some boning, plenty of clasps, not too wide a ""U"" shape, etc. However, the cups themselves were unbelievably small and conical. I purchased a 32DD, but it appeared to have been accidentally paired with a B cup, for all the lack of fabric! What little cup there was formed nearly point at the center- not precisely the shape I had in mind, even if I could manage to squeeze half a breast into each of those absurdly shallow cups! Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I don't think cones work well on anyone short of Madonna. But even she wouldn't be able to make this ridiculously proportioned bra work.",1

"They were comfortable once you got them on, but it was really a struggle. They are a little thicker, and tighter than most pantyhose. The color (little color) was darker than I expected, they looked almost orange. As I was putting them on for the first (and last) time,  they got a hole ripped in the front support panel near the top. It wasn't noticeable, but I won't be able to wear them again. The material feels a little strange, and since my thighs rub together it got a little uncomfortable, so I had to wear shorts underneath my dress so I didn't irritate my thighs. Like I said before, once they were on they were comfortable, but they didn't last very long.",1
"The product description specifically says ""Sturdy and durable construction"". Well, mine came apart along the in-seam after just second wearing. This happens to be a special interlocked type of seam, and yet it was not strong enough to stay together. The fit was perfectly fine out of the bag. And I engaged in no unusual stretching or pulling during the wear. Heck, I am wearing these while acting as the water-boy for my kid's ski camp. Not trying out for US long jump Olympics team, that they should rip so easily.For comparison, I have another pair of FOTL thermals, which I had bought a couple years ago. That one is still fine, with no tearing or seams coming apart. I am not even sure if this is genuine FOTL product or not, given such poor durability from the well known brand. Staying with brick and mortar stores for such purchases from now on.",1
In the picture they go up to your knees but the ones they send me were up a little above my ankles !!!I paid like $23.00 for each pair and $16.00 each pair at the cleaners to get 8 inches taken off andreps repaired  !!!,1
Not real brand. Converse label on wrong sides idiots,1
The jeans were very Slow in getting to me and they were way too big.  I buy the same size each time for my husband and these were way too big.,0
Bad product. Good for the winter but a pain to put on and off. And I got wide ones too..for what? They are a hassle to fit in!!,1
No cushion for ankles or soles like the pair I bought my son last year.  Support is everything in shoes so not sure if I would recommend these.,1
I really wasn't a fan of these tights. I was looking for something with more tummy control and the weren't sheer enough and way to tight on the legs. My legs are fine. I needed it tight around my tummy,1

"From your page:Levi's Men's 505 Straight (Regular) Fit JeanThese are not the same thing, nor are they the same jeans. Regular Fit 505 jeans were discontinued by Levi's. Their replacement is the Straight Fit, which among other things, has less belt loops and doesn't seem to fit worth a damn. Please, Amazon, at least fix the wording, there is no such thing as 505 Straight (Regular) Fit Levi's.I would gladly buy 2 pair of regular fit 505s right now, but there aren't any, so I had to buy a used pair off of ebay.After that wears out, I guess I'll go naked. I'll never buy what they are currently selling. Some things should nto be messed with. Levi's 505 regular fit jeans were great the way they were.**UPDATE** 27 June 2013Upon checking the Levi's website recently, I saw most wanted items one of which was 505 regular fit. So I click on it, and there are all the same pictures as when they were selling 505 straight jeans. So I contacted customer support:ME:So, last year I got what may be one of the last pairs of 505 regular fit jeans I'll ever buy, because you decided to discontinue them in favor 505 straight whatever hell that is. Now your site states that again sell 505 regular fit jeans yet the pictures all show the 505 straight (as noted by only having 5 belt loops...), so which is it? Are you truly selling REAL 505 regular fit jeans again, or are pulling a fast one on everyone and selling the straight crap as regular fit? I swear you will never get another dime from me or my family until you bring back original '60s through 2011/2012 era 505 regular fit jeans. (plain old dark blue denim new looking jeans. I don't need 40 different colors or holes in the knee from the factory. I don't need them to look like they've been worn in, I'll do that on my own. I'll go naked or wear shorts and sweats to work if I have to, before I ever buy anything else you make. Please tell me your selling the real deal again.Received from LEVI'S 17 Jun 2013:Diana here from Levi Strauss & Co. Thanks for contacting us.Levi's 505 are still a straight fit with a straight leg opening. We have updated the styles name only, we suggest trying Levi's 501 or 550 jeans which are similar to the regular 505 jeans.If you need additional assistance, please give us a call at 1-800-USA-LEVI. We're here Monday through Friday from 6:00am to 4:30pm Pacific time.DianaLevi Strauss & Co.Consumer RelationsCase ID: 4109284So, to add insult to injury, they came out with a new jean, 505 straight to replace the discontinued 505 Regular Fit, and then when people complained, they just said F.U. and changed the name of the new ones to 505 Regular Fit.I have filed a complaint with the BBB for false advertising and misrepresenting an item. I doubt it will do any good, but this is just a bunch of BS!!!!!!**Update** Febraury 2015So, now the Levi's web site for any 505 regualr fit says sits at waist and when I looked at some in a local store, the tag says sits at waist. Unfortuantely, there are still only 5 belt loops, inconsistant material, different colors of thread bewteen the outside pocket stiching and the across-the- pocket stiching (was yallow isntead of gold/orange) and in some cases, tiny shallow front pockets.It appears they have changed only enough of the details back to avoid a law suit, but the jeans are still not what we all want. I guess I will continue to buy Wranglers, even though I hate them, because they have everything the fake Levi's 505 Regular Fit don't...",0

I didn't return the product because it didn't seem worth the hassle, since she she'll wear them.  But if you have a more particular toddler than me, I wouldn't risk buying this product based on the image presented.

The size is much bigger than exact model (""12M Jungle Moc"") manufactured earlier. The product number on the box, and the product number in the shoe, match each other, and they indicate the ""12M"" size. But they are visibly bigger (about 1/4"" wider AND longer) than earlier 12M Jungle Moc's. This is maybe the 6th pair of 12M Jungle Moc's I've purchased from Amazon in the past three years (I wear them out after 4 months and 300 miles of walking).

"This bra was a huge disappointment. Amazon's return service was just the moldy cherry on my rancid lingerie shopping experience.To be fair, I have been a customer of Amazon's for years, starting back when they only sold books. I jumped on the Prime membership right away and haven't let the membership expire since. Amazon normally provides great service, which is why I was so shocked by the poor response to my refund request here. The bra itself seemed oddly shaped, as if the cups had boning in them or something. And I don't mean around the edges, where an underwire would run, I mean straight through the center of the cup. I can't imagine that being very flattering. Not only that, but the size of the cups appeared to be much smaller compared to other strapless bras I own of the same size. I thought that perhaps I had received a defective bra... I couldn't imagine that it was supposed to look the way it did. (The cup itself was a different fabric on the inside than the rest of the torso- this is mainly what made me suspect a defect. But who knows, maybe they MEANT to give ladies trapezoid boobs.)No problem, I just returned the bra. After all, as you can see in the product description, Amazon claims that this product is available for FREE returns if we are dissatisfied. APPARENTLY, free returns mean that they charge you for shipping, and they only refund less than a third of the price. This means that I just paid Amazon $24 for the honor of looking at one of their bras. Oh how I wish this were a lame punchline to a joke...",1

"The boots are very comfortable.  It feels like I'm wearing slippers.  The problem is we haven't even begun to experience really cold days and I can already tell these boots will not be warm enough for a full blown Colorado winter.  It has been about 28 degrees and snowy the past few days.  My feet are cold in spite of wearing my new boots.  Not sure what I'm going to do when the temp is in the single digits.  When I purchased them, all of the reviews said they would be great in cold weather.  I'm really disappointed that they are not as warm as what was implied in the product description. They are kind of fun in a fashion sort of way, but I bought them for warmth.",1

"I ordered this for my husband for Halloween. He is going as Maverick and I bought the corresponding dog tags. It's a nice costume as far as fit and  quality goes (not amazing but not bad compared to many Halloween costume quality standards), but the product description as well as the bag it came in says it includes both Maverick and Goose name tags. Ours only came with Goose. We checked the bag and all the pockets multiple times. Annoying. I don't have time to send it back or order a new one since we have a party to go to in 2 days so I will have to go buy a Maverick tag at the local Halloween store.",1

"How many times can I say ""crappy"" before it becomes redundant? The edging is horrible, the polyester has light discoloration spots on some of the edges, and the barely tacked on crocheting looks like it could unravel any second. Part of my displeasure is my own fault for paying more attention to the review that called the materials ""fine thin black silk"" rather than the product description of ""sheer polyester."" Some polyester is not complete crap and can be described as silky. Not this stuff. It is not worth the initial shipping fee, plus the 15% restocking fee, plus a ship back fee to return the scarf so I will keep it. That is the only reason. Don't buy this scarf. There are cheaper scarfs on amazon that are probably just as craptacular.",1
It was missing the yarn wig and gloves that were supposed to be included.  The only reason I didn't return it was too late for me to find another costume so it was good thing i had also ordered a better wig.,0

Now I'm embarrassed that I recommended it so highly to my son-in-law, and can only hope that his doesn't die in the next year or so.  No more Invictas for me.",1

I gave it the college try and wore them for a week and a half. 'give them a chance to 'break in', I thought. . . it only got worse. steer clear. it is unfortunate, but there are pretty much no cute shoes that are both all white AND comfortable for anyone over the age of 25 that needs to be on their feet all day. go with brooks or new balance walkers. both brands are ugg-butt, but comfy! it aint cute walking funny the next day, either--so it all evens out. don't bother with leather chuck taylors or adidas shell-toes, either. trust me. save yourself some time and just get the right shoes in the first place.

I wasn't please with this product. It was way to thin and too small.  I did read the product description and was for certain that I was getting what I wanted and sadly it was not what I wanted.

"THIS COMPANY SUCKS! I gave it a 1 as you cannot give a 0. First they sent me an email saying my order shipped. I looked at their email and noticed they did not send what I ordered but sent something else. I responded telling them this was not what I ordered and described what I did order. Their reply? ""We don't have that advertised on Amazon"". I replied back again and included the Amazon receipt describing what I ordered. Their reply? It was an advertising error. We don't have that color. I emailed 2 more times suggesting 2 other colors they advertised. They told me I could keep what they sent or send it back. So much for their 100% satisfaction guaranteed! Their attitude was we will send you what we want and too bad if it was not what you ordered. 1 month later I have still not received anything. I have filed a complaint with Amazon and VISA. They told VISA the BS ""we will refund his money when we receive it back"". I also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. They did not respond to the first contact by the BBB. My experience with this company is that they have false advertising, will exchange your order without attempting to contact you and to bad if you don't like it, then stall when you request a refund.I move in 4 days and still have not received whatever it was they say they sent. You are taking your chances if you buy anything from this company.",0

"Flimsy and kinda low quality. Most of the decals are actually stickers that are hastily applied, some of which were peeling off when I took it out of the package. The parts that ARE painted began chipping off almost immediately. I might have a weird shaped head, but the helmet wobbles a lot while wearing it, and it's incredibly difficult to see out of the eyeholes. The front and back of the helmet are held together with flimsy plastic clips, so the pieces of the helmet don't fit together all that well.On the whole, it served it's purpose as a cheap, last minute Halloween costume... But if you're looking for a collector's item or display piece, spring for a more expensive helmet.",1
